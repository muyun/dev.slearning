In 1771, the Spanish founded the first Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel in the area that is now known as Whittier Narrows on the border between Montebello and Rosemead. In 1775, the mission moved to avoid the spring floods that ruined the first crops, to its present location in San Gabriel.\nDuring the Spanish Colonial era, the area that is now the City of Rosemead was part of the land administered by the San Gabriel Mission. As part of the Mexican government's Secularization Act of 1833, the land, formerly held by the Mission, was distributed to private citizens, requiring only that they build a house and graze cattle, bringing to an end the Mission Era Following the Mexican-American War and the 1848 signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe which transferred sovereignty over the territory now known as the State of California to the United States, Anglo-American immigration began to flow to the area. The southern part of Rosemead was part of Rancho Potrero Grande (Large Pasture) which was originally granted to a Native American man named Manuel Antonio, who was a \"mayordomo\" (overseer) at the San Gabriel Mission. The ranch was later transferred to Juan Matias S\u00e1nchez.\nIn 1852, John and Harriet Guess moved cross-country in an ox drawn wagon, to the San Gabriel Valley from Conway County, Arkansas. In 1855, the couple camped where present-day Savannah Elementary School is located on Rio Hondo Avenue. They rented the land until 1867, when John Guess purchased of a ranch and named it Savannah. The land stretched from Valley Boulevard to Marshall Street, and from Rosemead Boulevard to the Eaton Wash.\nOther pioneers, Frank Forst and Leonard John Rose, also settled in this valley. Rose and his wife Amanda bought about of land between what is now Rosemead Boulevard and Walnut Grove Avenue. Rose bred and trained horses for a living. He named his ranch \"Rose's Meadow\" which was eventually shortened to Rosemeade and gave the city its name. Rosemeade was once again shortened to Rosemead. The peaceful, pastoral community flourished with small truck farms and rabbit and chicken farms. Settlers moved in and also raised vegetables, fruits, grain and feed for the animals.\nIt wasn't until August 4, 1959, the citizens elected to incorporate Rosemead into a city.\nRosemead Airport is one of the vanished former airports which once were spread all throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

At some point between 1942-44 the airport was renamed Rosemead, as that is how it was labeled on the 1944 LA Sectional Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of John Voss).\nA flying school was also operated at Rosemead Airport.\nFletcher Aviation sold to AJ Industries in the 1960s, AJ immediately sold the portion of the land from Rio Hondo Avenue almost to Rosemead Boulevard to AeroJet Corporation and they built a large facility there. It was named Flair Park and the roadway that parallels I-10 was named Flair Drive.\nDemographics in Rosemead changed significantly in the 1990s. Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants in large numbers started moving in and opening businesses: ethnic restaurants and stores. The Whittier Daily News stated \"The atmosphere certainly became more urban, in a Hong Kong way.\" The small town ambience changed dramatically. The formerly conservative government changed when young John Tran was elected to the city council. The more seasoned portion of the city council supported keeping a safe and secure quality in the small town while rejecting some of Tran's more radical ideas such as a five story city hall, high density development and ushering out the Sheriff's Department and establishing a Rosemead Police Department, a move that would have cost the city millions of dollars, especially during the recession that followed during that period. Tran also supported a ballot initiative to change to a Charter city, (like Bell, CA.), which the voters soundly rejected. Tran lost in the next city election by one vote.\nRosemead is part of a cluster of cities (along with Arcadia, Temple City, Monterey Park, San Marino, and San Gabriel) in the west San Gabriel Valley with a growing Asian population.

The Arkansas and Choctaw Railroad connected Ashdown to Arkinda, and the growth of the Kansas City Southern Railway, the Frisco and the Memphis, Dallas and Gulf Railroad continued to grow the city and her timber industry, which had been utilizing steamboats and flatboats to ship lumber.\nFollowing World War II, Ashdown's economy began to diversify. Its location near two rivers attracted manufacturing plants, such as Coca-Cola bottling plant, box factory, clothing plant, ice plant and a pallet plant. The United States Army Corps of Engineers dammed the Little River and Saline River at their confluence in 1966, forming Millwood Lake.

The name Camilla was chosen in honor of the granddaughter of Henry Mitchell, an American Revolutionary War general for whom Mitchell County was named.\nCamilla and Mitchell County were originally Creek country surrendered to the United States in the 1814 Treaty at Fort Jackson. Georgia divided the land ceded by Native Americans into lots to be given away in land lotteries. The lottery of 1820 awarded lands covering much of the southwest section of the state (applying only to land south of the future Lee County line and extending west to Chattahoochee and east to settled counties in east Georgia), including the area later known as Mitchell County. Despite having access to free land, few people moved to the region. Citizens hesitated to improve land, according to an early twentieth-century history the region, \u201c\"which God Almighty had left in an unfinished condition.\" It took approximately forty years (1820\u20131857) for the area to obtain its necessary legal population to become a separate county, after which Camilla became the county\u2019s seat.\nCamilla became the site of a racially motivated political riot on Saturday, September 19, 1868. Determined to promote political and social reform with an organized rally, 150\u2013300 freedmen, along with Republican political candidates, marched toward the town\u2019s courthouse square for the rally. The local sheriff and \"citizens committee\" in the majority-white town warned the black and white activists of the impending violence and demanded that they forfeit their guns, even though carrying weapons was customary at the time. The marchers refused to give up their guns and continued to the courthouse square, where a group of local whites, quickly deputized by the sheriff, fired upon them. This assault forced the Republicans and freedmen to retreat as locals gave chase into the swamps, killing an estimated nine to fifteen of the black rally participants while wounding forty others. \"Whites proceeded through the countryside over the next two weeks, beating and warning Negroes that they would be killed if they tried to vote in the coming election.\" The Camilla Massacre was the culmination of smaller acts of violence committed by white inhabitants that had plagued southwest Georgia since the end of the Civil War.\nOn 23 July 1962, a group of civil rights activists tried to visit fellow demonstrators from Albany, Georgia that had been jailed in Camilla. While the rally took place, Marion King, wife of Albany Movement's vice president Slater King, was beaten to the ground and kicked by Camilla police guards until she was unconscious. Mrs. King was pregnant at the time and had her young children with her. She suffered a miscarriage after the ordeal. The 2012 song Camilla from the eponymous album by Caroline Herring pays a tribute to Mrs. King's memory.\nIn the early 2000s, the city was hit by two disastrous sets of tornadoes, both occurring in the dark hours of the early morning and both going through roughly the same area.

When he returned to Miraj in 1800, after his many campaigns, and having reached his majority, he found his uncle unwilling to yield control to him. Disgusted with this state of affairs, the young nephew seized the family idol and left the palace in a huff. In 1801 he established himself at a new capital at Sangli and set about taking control over as much of his patrimony as he was able. Continuing quarrels and disagreements threatened to cause fighting until the British Resident at the Peshwa's court decided to settle the matter by effecting an agreement in 1812. This Treaty of Pandharpur was formally recognised by the British authorities in 1817 and further augmented by separate treaties with the HEIC in 1819.\nChintamanrao reigned for fifty years, during which he maintained very close relations with the British. His participation in the southern campaigns included a close association with the Duke of Wellington, with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship. He served in several other campaigns, even offering to lead contingents to Persia and Afghanistan to fight the company's enemies. However, his interests ranged more widely than mere soldering. He encouraged industry and agriculture, took an interest in religious affairs, and promoted inter-communal and inter-faith understanding, more than a century before it became the norm. He died in 1851, aged seventy-five, full of honours and respect.\nDhundirajrao succeeded his father not merely as ruler, but also in continuing the good work begun by his father. However, he took a keener interest in education, building schools, colleges and vocational institutions. This interest extended to the fields of female education and the so-called backwards classes, for whom he built special schools. He even promoted education amongst his Muslim subjects, a community who until then were suspicious of modern innovations. Thanks to his efforts in promoting various agricultural enterprises, Sangli is today the centre of the world turmeric trade, has the largest sugar refinery in Asia and is the most important centre for grape production in India. Despite seven marriages, he only sired two daughters. The succession was left to a distant relative, chosen by the British authorities and adopted by his senior widow.\nVinayakrao Chintamanrao, who succeeded as Chintamanrao Dhundirajrao on adoption, was no less distinguished than his two predecessors. He also reigned for a long period of sixty-four years. During this time he vastly improved the material, educational, spiritual and political development of his people. He promoted industrial and agricultural development on an unprecedented scale, making his little state something of a powerhouse in the area. Educational facilities were expanded in many areas with the establishment of arts, science, engineering and medical colleges. Access to capital improved with the foundation of a state bank, which helped poor farmers and fledgeling industrialists to raise funds. Representative institutions at local and state level encouraged the growth of democracy. He took an active part in supporting the war effort, in the activities of the Chamber of Princes, the Indian Round Table Conferences in London, and on the committee established to create a federal structure for India. A friend of the British and Gandhi alike, he enthusiastically supported independence and acceded to the Dominion India in 1947, then merged his state with Bombay. Raja Vijaysinhrao Patwardhan succeeded his grandfather in 1965.

The cities have important education centers offering graduate and post graduate quality education in the areas of arts, science, management, medicine, and engineering. The twin cities offer infrastructure that includes railway junction, hotels, housing, public transport, telephone, high speed internet, a multiplex, shopping mall and a state-of-art sports complex.\nSangli is now emerging as one of the largest power generation hubs of India. Reliance Wind Energy (RWE), is setting up 150 MW wind power project worth Rs 900 crore with Suzlon Energy. Suzlon Energy will set up the wind farm in Sangli, one of the known wind zones in the state. Sangli has the largest trading centre for turmeric in Asia. The green city is inside what is called 'Sugar Belt' of Maharashtra. The district has more than thirteen sugar factories, which makes it among the highest sugar-producing districts of India. It also has oil seeds, commodities and fruit market. Sangli is also known for high quality grapes and houses many state and privately owned cold storage facilities. A grape wine park spread over 1.42 km\u00b2 (350 acres) has been established at Palus, 30 km from Sangli city. A brand new Sangli Food Park, spread across 1.2 km\u00b2 (300 acres) is under construction at Alkud ManeRajuri.\nSangli is also one of the largest Grape growing regions in Maharashtra. Government has established Krishna Valley Wine Park 30 km away from Sangli to promote wine industry also Pomegranates are cultivated in the north east region of the district. Recently, Sangli has come up as a major wind power generation location in India. Suzlon has set up large wind farms around Sangli city with a capacity to generate over 900 MW of power. Sangli has number of renowned education institutes which includes Walchand College of Engineering (established in 1947), Willingdon College (established in 1919), City High School (established in 1914) and Sangli High School (established in 1907). Still Sangli City expanding by its area and population though it signs many top companies have to be in the domestic industry causes needs and new employment.\nThe state government also has proposed a large phase of land for occupation of new Sangli Airport near the suburb Kavalapur which could beneficial in the growth of the City Business Development. The work is in the progress of the National Highway which is from Shirval to Chikkodi (Karnataka) via Lonand, Phaltan, Atpadi, Vita, Tasgaon, Sangli and ahead via Miraj, Belgum to Chikkodi which would be a standard transportation service from the city to another place. Sangli railway station under Pune Railway division serves Sangli city. , a railway Junction is 7 km from the Sangli.\nKavathe Ekand is place located 18km from Sangli famous for fireworks presentation on every Dasara festival\nSangli is the birthplace of many people notable for their contributions as social, cultural as well as political reformers.\n- Yashwantrao Chavan \u20131st chief minister of MAHARASHTRA State\n- Vasantdada Patil, - Ex Chief minister of Maharashtra, Padmale\n- Gulabrao Patil - Ex.

In 1911, the state had a revenue estimated at \u00a310,000. Sangli joined the dominion of India on March 8, 1948 and is currently a part of the state of Maharashtra.\nSangli was one of the 11-gun salute princely states of British India, under the Kolhapur-Deccan Residency in the Bombay Presidency, and later the Deccan States Agency. It was one of the southern Maratha Jagirs. Its territory was widely scattered among other native states and British districts.\nThe Sangli-Miraj & Kupwad City Municipal Corporation (S.M.K.M.C.)is the local self-government body which looks after the development of the Sangli-Miraj twin cities, serving 0.5 million citizens. The corporation is continuously working in following aspects of development:\nRoads and Highways \u2013 construction, repair, widening, street lighting, drainage,\nslum eradication and waste management\nHowever, regarding Irrigation and Water Supply, the city is ill-famed for poor water quality for many years.\nTurmeric production and trade in nearby areas of Sangli city follows a centuries-old practice\u2014storing turmeric in pits. These pits stretch far out in the open fields of the villages of Haripur and Sangalwadi. It is possibly the most unusual agricultural commodity-storage system in the country.\nAfter clearing the loose soil covering the pit, it is left open for about two to three hours. One cannot enter the pit until one finds out if there is any oxygen within. To ascertain this, a lantern is lowered into the pit. If the lantern does not go out, it is safe to enter the pit.\nIt was this ingenious storage system, devised over 200 years ago, that turned Sangli into a major trading centre for turmeric. Raw turmeric sold by farmers is stored in these pits, eighteen to twenty feet (five to six metres) deep, for three to four years. The pits provide the best storage facility for turmeric, as the quality of the commodity remains unchanged. The turmeric hardens and matures while in storage. Today, more than 80% of the turmeric trade in India takes place in Sangli. \nThe world record for largest lezim dance was achieved by Sangli Shikshan Sanstha in 2014 as a part of centenary year celebrations of the educational institute. A total 3066 girls and 4272 boys from 19 different schools situated across 14 towns and 5 villages participated. The attempt took place on 26 January 2014 the 65th Republic Day of India at Shivaji stadium.\nSangli is home to many colleges, most of which are affiliated to Shivaji University, Kolhapur.\nThe sanctuary is forested, but with grassy hill slopes. The forests are southern dry mixed deciduous and southern thorn forest. Protection from grazing and forest fire has resulted in good regeneration of dry deciduous species. The forest department introduced many plants in the area, including Tamarind, Neem, Nilgiri, Acacia, Agave, and Khair.\nFlora and fauna:\nLarge animals found in the sanctuary include several types of deer (Sambar Deer, Blackbucks, Muntjac, Chital, Gazelle) as well as wild boar and peacocks. Small carnivores like hyena, fox and porcupines are also found in the area. A large number of insects, birds and reptiles such as pythons and other snakes are also present.\nTourism:\nThe sanctuary is a popular tourist destination, with the peak tourism season being from August to February. The most popular tourist activity is hiking to the top of a hill in the sanctuary, from which one can see the Krishna River flowing through fields of sugarcane and grapevines. Also in the area are numerous shrines to Shiva which were built during the Chalukya dynasty, and the Krishna Valley Wine Park in Palus.\nAbout Sagareshwar:\nThe Sagareshwar sanctuary has much religious, cultural and archaeological significance. The sanctuary derives its name from an ancient famous Shiva temple that attracts a large number of devotees. It actually consists of one large temple and a complex of 51 small temples, all from the Satvahana period. You will find the Kamal Bhairao temple, partially hewn from hard Basalt rock perched on the edge of a steep cliff. The entrance to the temple is through a narrow tunnel.\nGanesh temple is the greatest religious attraction in Sangli. It is the Kuldaivat of Patwardhans. Besides the main temple of Ganesh there are four more, but smaller ones, of Suryanarayan, Cintamanesvar, Laksmi-Narayan and Chinta\u2212manesvari, which together with the chief deity forms the Ganapati panchayatan.\nThe construction of the temple was started by the late Sri Appasaheb Patwardhan. The basalt stone blocks used for the construction were brought from the Jyotiba hills near Kolhapur.\nThe whole structure stands on a fairly large quadrangular court. The Princely residence is close by and facing the river, on which side there is a wall flanked by two bastions and loopholed for musketry. Sri Chintamanrav Appahaheb Patvardhan built the mandap at a later date. The stone used is of the same type as that employed for the construction of the original temple and the sculptural work and the designs are also befitting the original shrine. It was completed in 1952 and was inaugurated by Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.\nA huge and massive gate of red sand\u2212stone, recently constructed, leads into the spacious courtyard. The gate has grandeur of its own and is the work of skilled architects and artisans of great repute. It is composed of three arches for entry. The central arch is bigger than the side ones. In the courtyard two lotus shaped fountains can be seen.\nA mandap hall is supported on eight polished and ornamented pillars supporting galleries on both sides. The ceiling of the mandap bears beautiful designs, a huge chandelier hanging from the centre of the ceiling. In addition to the main entrance there are four more doors, two on either side. On the wall are reproduced sacred hymns from the Bhagavad Gita. On the right side of the hall, the sandalwood-crafted chariot with the images of Arjuna and Krushna can be seen. It delineates Krishna preaching Bhagvadgita to Arjuna when he refused to right ihe Kauravas on the historic battle\u2212field of Kuruksetra.\nThe 1.16 sq. m pedestal of black stone supports white marble idol of Ganesh, with Riddhi and Siddhi idols. This part is approached by steps fixed at both the extreme ends. The Garbhagriha is crowned by a shikhar with a brass spire plated with gold. It bears various designs and carvings and figure\u2212filled niches, In the corners there are smaller replicas of the main Shikhara.\nThe shrine as a whole is one of the excellent specimen of stone carvings and polished stone\u2212work. Of the remaining four temples of the panchayatan, two, viz., Chintamanesvar and Suryanarayan are on the right side, arranged one behind the other, placing one of the fountains mentioned above in the middle. The other two, viz., Lakshmi\u2212Narayan and Chintamanesvari are on the left also arranged in the same manner. Behind the temple of Suryanarayan there is the stone sculpture of a baby elephant trampling a tiger.\nGanapati Panchayatan Trust maintains the temple. The trust receives grants from Patvardhans, as a part of tradition which continues till the present day. In the backyard of the Ganesha temple court there is a small black stone idol of Kuranesvari housed in a small arch of stone.\nHindu Religion\n- Shreekshetra Audumbar\n- Battis Shirala-\n- Gorakhnath Shrine\n- Ambbai Temple\n- Bhairavnath Temple - Panumbre Tarf Shirala\n- Bhuvneshwari Temple\n- Brahmanand Swami Math\n- Narsobawadi\n- Dandoba - The place of lord Shiva near Miraj at the top of a mountain surrounded by forest.\n- Sangameshwar (Haripur) - on the confluenace of rivers Krishna and Warna\n- Shree Ganapti Mandir Tasgaon\n- Bhavani Devi mandir- Balawadi Tal-khanapur\n- Hanuman Temple Haroli, Tal- K.Mahankal\nCultural and Spiritual Heritage\nGanesh Chaturthi The festival spares Happines to Everyone,\nSangli is often visited by many saints, Yogis, tapaswis like Swami Vivekananda for their tapa, s\u0101dhan\u0101 and satsang.

Straddling a bend in the South Saskatchewan River and along the Trans-Canada Yellowhead Highway, it has served as the region's cultural and economic hub since it was founded in 1882 as a Temperance colony. At its 2016 census population of 246,376, Saskatoon is the largest city in the province, while at a 2016 census population of 295,095, the Saskatoon census metropolitan area (CMA) is the 17th largest CMA in Canada. The City of Saskatoon has estimated its population to be 271,000 as of July 2017, while Statistics Canada has estimated the CMA's population to have to be 315,200 as of 2016.\nSaskatoon is home to the University of Saskatchewan, the Meewasin Valley Authority which protects the South Saskatchewan River and provides for the city's popular riverbank park spaces, and Wanuskewin Heritage Park, a National Historic Site of Canada representing 6,000 years of First Nations history. The Rural Municipality of Corman Park No. 344, the most populous rural municipality in Saskatchewan, surrounds the city and contains many of the developments associated with it, including Wanuskewin.\nSaskatoon is named after the berry of the same name, which is native to the region, and is itself derived from the Cree . The city has a significant Indigenous population and several urban Reserves. The city has eight (plus two planned) river crossings and is nicknamed \"Paris of the Prairies\" and \"Bridge City.\"\nHistoric neighbourhoods of Saskatoon include Nutana and Riversdale, which were separate towns before amalgamating with the town of Saskatoon and incorporating as a city in 1906. Nutana, Riversdale, their historic main streets of Broadway Avenue and 20th Street respectively, the downtown core and other central neighbourhoods are seeing significant reinvestment and redevelopment. Sutherland, the rail town the city annexed in 1956 that lies beyond the University lands, is now another historic neighbourhood.\n", "text": "The name Saskatoon [in , \"Saskatoon\" or the locatives: mis\u00e2skwat\u00f4minihk, lit: \"at the saskatoon berry\", mis\u00e2skwat\u00f4minisk\u00e2hk, \"at the place of many saskatoon berries\", m\u00eenisihk \"at the berry\"] comes from the Cree inanimate noun mis\u00e2skwat\u00f4mina \"saskatoon berries\", which refers to the sweet, violet-coloured berry that grows in the area.\nIn 1882, the Toronto-based Temperance Colonization Society was granted 21 sections of land straddling the South Saskatchewan River, between what is now Warman and Dundurn. The aim of the group was to escape the liquor trade in that city and set up a \"dry\" community in the Prairie region. The following year settlers, led by John Neilson Lake, arrived on the site of what is now Saskatoon and established the first permanent settlement. The settlers travelled by railway from Ontario to Moose Jaw and then completed the final leg via horse-drawn cart as the railway had yet to be completed to Saskatoon.\nIn 1885 the Northwest Rebellion affected the tiny community in a variety of ways. Chief Whitecap and Charles Trottier passed through the present day University campus on their way to join Louis Riel's armed forces at Batoche, Saskatchewan. Following the fighting at the Battle of Fish Creek, and the Battle of Batoche, wounded Canadian soldiers convalesced at the Marr Residence which is today a historic site. A few died in care and were buried in the Pioneer Cemetery near the Exhibition Grounds.\nA town charter for the west side of the river was obtained in 1903 (Nutana became a village in that year). In 1906 Saskatoon became a city with a population of 4,500, which included the communities of Saskatoon, Riversdale and Nutana. In 1955 Montgomery Place and in 1956 the neighbouring town of Sutherland were annexed by the fast-growing City of Saskatoon.\nThe economy of Saskatoon has been associated with potash, oil and agriculture (specifically wheat), resulting in the moniker \"POW City\". Various grains, livestock, oil and gas, potash, uranium, gold, diamond, coal and their spin off industries fuel the economy. The world's largest publicly traded uranium company, Cameco, and the world's largest potash producer, PotashCorp, have corporate headquarters in Saskatoon. Saskatoon is also the new home of BHP Billiton's Diamonds and Specialty Products business unit. Nearly two-thirds of the world's recoverable potash reserves are in the Saskatoon region. Innovation Place founded in 1980 brings together almost 150 agriculture, information technology, and environmental, life sciences and agricultural biotechnology industries in a science park or technology park setting. Saskatoon is also home to the Canadian Light Source, Canada's national synchrotron facility.\nSaskatoon\u2019s digital media scene is growing with start-up tech companies such as Noodlecake, Point2, Vendasta Technologies, and Zu.\nOne of Saskatoon's nicknames, \"Hub City\", refers to its ideal central location within Canada for distribution and logistics. Saskatoon John G. Diefenbaker International Airport with 105,620 aircraft movements in 2008 was listed as the 19th busiest airport in Canada, 12th busiest in passenger traffic.\nSaskatoon is developing the South Central Business District, or block 146, which is called the River Landing Project. Long range planning is underway for an expected city population of 325,000 by 2028 (2011 MXD report).\nSaskatoon was expected to see a 4.2 percent growth in gross domestic product for the year 2012. The city saw a 3.4% growth in 2004, 5.1% increase in 2005 and a 2.8% increase in 2006. Saskatoon held Canada's No. 1 economic growth spot for Canada in 2005 according to the Conference Board of Canada. The Conference Board again predicted the city would rate first for economic increase in 2012, showing a growth rate of 4.2%. The Saskatoon Regional Economic Development Authority (SREDA) has also been ranked amongst Canada's top ten economic development organizations by Site Selection magazine.\nSaskatoon lies on a long belt of rich, potassic chernozem in middle-southern Saskatchewan and is found in the aspen parkland biome. The lack of surrounding mountainous topography gives the city a relatively flat grid, though the city does sprawl over a few hills and into a few valleys. The lowest point in the city is the river, while the highest point is disputed between the suburb of Sutherland in the east side and the Silverwood-River Heights areas in the city's north end. Saskatoon, on a cross-section from west to east, has a general decline in elevation above sea level heading towards the river, and on the east bank of the river, the terrain is mostly level until outside the city, where it begins to decrease in elevation again.\nSaskatoon is divided into east and west sides by the South Saskatchewan River. It is then divided into Suburban Development Areas (SDA) which are composed of neighbourhoods. Street addresses are demarcated into north and south (for avenues aligned in those directions) and similar east and west (for streets aligned in those directions). West of the river the demarcation line for north and south addresses is 22nd Street, while east and west are divided by Idylwyld Drive (north of 20th Street) and Avenue A (south of 20th). On the east side, Lorne Avenue demarcates east and west while Aird Street marks the north/south boundary, except in the Sutherland community where a separate east/west demarcation takes place with Central Avenue as the boundary (there is, however, no separate north/south divide). As a result of the unusual demarcation on the east side, few streets actually carry a \"North\" or \"West\" designation. \nA second major water feature aside from the river is the Hudson Bay Slough, a remnant of a glacier-formed body of water that at one time dominated the northern end of the city. Industrial development has resulted in most of the slough being drained, however a large remnant has been preserved off Avenue C as part of RCAF Memorial Park, and another portion remains intact within the Hudson Bay Industrial area.\nPike Lake and Blackstrap Provincial Parks are south of the city. Blackstrap Park is often used for school field trips. Batoche is north of the city.\nSaskatoon experiences a borderline cold semi-arid/humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSk/). Climate data from University of Saskatchewan, in the inner city meets semi-arid criteria. This is due to slightly higher average annual temperature and slightly lower average annual precipitation than the Airport, on the city's northwest periphery.\nThe city has four distinct seasons and is in plant hardiness zone 3b. Saskatoon has a dry climate and sees of precipitation per year on average, with the summer being the wettest season. Saskatoon is sunnier than average in Canada as a result, averaging 2,268 hours of bright sunshine annually. The extreme temperatures are typically accompanied by below average levels of humidity. Thunderstorms are common in the summer months and can be severe with torrential rain, hail, high winds, intense lightning and, on rare occasion, tornadoes. The frost-free growing season lasts from 21 May to 15 September, but due to Saskatoon's northerly location, damaging frosts have occurred as late as June 14 and again as early as August. The average daytime high temperature peaks at from July 31 to August 8.\nThe \"Blizzard of 2007\" was described by many residents as the worst they had seen and paralyzed the city with its low visibility, extreme cold and large volume of snow. Winds rose to over and an estimated of snow fell throughout the day. Many area residents took refuge overnight at area work places, shopping centres, hospitals and the university.\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Saskatoon was on 6 June 1988. The lowest temperature ever recorded was on 1 February 1893.\nThe 2016 census listed Saskatoon's population at 246,376, a 10.6 per cent increase over 2011. A civic estimate at the end of 2016 had Saskatoon's population at 265,300. and Saskatoon's CMA population as 305,000\nAccording to the 2006 census, 18% of the population consists of youths under the age of 15, while those over 65 constitute 13% of the population. The median age of Saskatoon residents is 35.5 years of age, four years younger than Canada as a whole. \nThe above land area figure was provided by the City of Saskatoon in January 2006 and takes into account recent annexations up to that point. It does not include the two large annexations of land that occurred in the summer of 2010. These portions of land have been zoned under the provincial land management acts.\nIn terms of race, according to the 2001 census, 190,120 or 85.4% of the city's population were white Canadians, 19,900 or 8.9% were Aboriginals, with less than 5% belonging to other visible minority Canadians such as Han Chinese, South Asians, etc. combined.\nSome 78.5% of Saskatoon's inhabitants profess to be Christian, mostly Protestant (40.1%) and Roman Catholic (32.5%). Another 19.6% of Saskatoon's inhabitants do not profess a religious faith at all. Minority faiths include Sikhism, Buddhism (0.7%), Judaism, Hinduism, and Islam (0.6%).\nThe Saskatoon area was inhabited long before any permanent settlement was established, to which the ongoing archaeological work at Wanuskewin Heritage Park and other locations bears witness. Canada's First Nations population has been increasingly urbanized, and nowhere is that more apparent than in Saskatoon, where the First Nations population increased by 382% from 1981 to 2001; however, a portion of this increase, possibly as much as half, is believed to be due to more people identifying themselves as Aboriginal in the census rather than migration or birth rate. Saskatoon has the second highest percentage of First Nations population among major Canadian cities at nearly 9%, behind Winnipeg at 10.2% and Regina close by with 8%; in certain neighbourhoods such as Pleasant Hill, this percentage exceeds 40%. Most First Nations residents are of Cree or Dakota cultural background although to a lesser extent Saulteaux, Assiniboine, and Dene communities also exist.\nSaskatoon also has a substantial M\u00e9tis population and is close to the historically significant Southbranch Settlements to the north, as well as the Prairie Ronde settlement near Dundurn, Saskatchewan.\nThe Saskatoon Health Region is responsible for health care delivery in the region. The health region operates three hospitals within the city boundaries, these include Royal University Hospital, Saskatoon City Hospital, and St. Paul's Hospital (Saskatoon). Royal University Hospital is a teaching and research hospital that operates in partnership with the University of Saskatchewan. The health region also operates hospitals in smaller neighbouring communities. In addition to hospitals the health region operates long-term care facilities, clinics and other health care services.\nThe Saskatoon Police Service is the primary police service for the city of Saskatoon and holds both Municipal and Provincial Jurisdiction. The following services also have jurisdiction in Saskatoon: Corman Park Police Service, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canadian National Railway Police Service and the Canadian Pacific Railway Police Service. As of December 31, 2012, the SPS had 442 sworn members, 59 Special Constables, and 136 civilian positions.\nThe 2006 census crime data, released July 18, 2007, showed Saskatoon leading Canada in violent crime, with 1,606 violent crimes per 100,000 residents annually. However, crime statistics produced by the Saskatoon Police Service shows that crime is on the decline. In 2010, total crimes against people went up 1.28% and total crimes against property fell by 11.75%.\nThere were accusations in the early 1990s that the Saskatoon police were engaging in starlight tours, where officers would arrest Aboriginal men and drive them out of the city in the dead of winter to abandon them. The majority of the accusations turned out to be false; however, several starlight tours did take place.\nOne of the city's landmarks is the Delta Bessborough Hotel, known to locals as the Bez. Built by the Canadian National Railway, it was among the last railway hotels to be started before the Great Depression of the 1930s brought their era to a close. Although the building was completed in 1932, it did not open its doors until 1935 due to the Depression. The Bessborough and the Mendel Art Gallery are the only major structures on the river side of Spadina Crescent. One of the most frequently circulated photographs of Saskatoon is of the hotel framed in one of the arches of the Broadway Bridge.\nThe Meewasin Valley Trail follows the South Saskatchewan River through Saskatoon. Summer activities include cycling, jogging and walking through parks and natural areas. Cross-country skiing is popular during the winter months, along with skating in Kiwanis Memorial Park. Access points are found throughout the city with interpretive signage and washrooms along the route. There are parks throughout the Meewasin Valley, with washrooms, picnic facilities, and lookout points along the river bank.\nIn the winter the Meewasin Skating Rink is open free to the public; it is in Kiwanis Memorial Park beside the Delta Bessborough hotel. The outdoor rink has been open since 1980.\nFor years, a parcel of land west of the Traffic Bridge, south of 19th Street, and east of Avenue C has been the subject of on-again, off-again redevelopment plans. The site formerly held the Saskatoon Arena, a power plant, a branch of the Royal Canadian Legion, and the head offices of the Saskatoon Public School Division; all these structures have been demolished to make way for redevelopment, with plans for same dating back to the 1980s. The most recent version of the plan called River Landing is ongoing. Calgary developer Lake Placid has proposed a 200 million dollar mega hotel/condo project to be built on the site although Lake Placid had difficulty securing financing and missed an October 30, 2009, deadline to submit a 4.5 million dollar payment for the parcel of land which seemingly killed the deal. On November 16, 2009, it was revealed by Lake Placid that the financing should be secure within a week. In April 2010, Saskatoon City Council voted in favour of entering new negotiations with Lake Placid over the site.\nAs of May 2010, landscaping and the development of the Frank & Ellen Remai Arts Centre a new performance venue for the Persephone Theatre had been completed on River Landing, joining a senior citizens residence that had been built in River Landing in the 1990s.

Both railways operate intermodal facilities and trans-load centers; while Canadian National Railway also operates an automotive transfer facility. Saskatoon is a stop on The Canadian passenger transcontinental rail route operated by Via Rail. The Saskatoon railway station is in the city's west end; it opened in the late 1960s as a replacement for Saskatoon's original main station which was on 1st Avenue downtown\u2014the relocation of the station sparked a major redevelopment of the downtown that included the construction of the Midtown Plaza, TCU Place (aka Centennial Auditorium) and other developments. The many provincial transportation connections and geographic location of Saskatoon give it one of its nicknames The Hub City. The Saskatchewan Railway Museum is just outside the city. Recent debates about moving all the railways out of the city are raising questions about a future LRT system, but the city's Mayor says the population is too small.\nSaskatoon/John G.

It was incorporated on May 22, 1907 as Pablo Beach, and would later change its name to Jacksonville Beach in 1925. The city is part of group of communities collectively referred to as the Jacksonville Beaches. These communities include Mayport, Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, and Ponte Vedra Beach. When the city of Jacksonville consolidated with Duval County in 1968, Jacksonville Beach, together with Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, and Baldwin, voted to retain their own municipal governments. As a result, citizens of Jacksonville Beach are also eligible to vote in mayoral election for the City of Jacksonville. As of the 2010 census, Jacksonville Beach had a total population of 21,362.\n", "text": "The area around present-day Jacksonville Beach was first settled by Spanish settlers. Spanish missions were established from Mayport to St. Augustine. Spain ceded Florida to Great Britain by treaty in 1763, only to have Spain regain it again, and then a final time in 1821 to the United States. American river pilots and fishermen came to Hazard, present-day Mayport, and established a port.\nIn the late 19th century, developers began to see the potential in Duval County's oceanfront as a resort. In 1883 a group of investors formed the Jacksonville and Atlantic Railroad with the intention of developing a resort community that would be connected to Jacksonville by rail. The first settlers were William Edward Scull, a civil engineer and surveyor, and his wife Eleanor Kennedy Scull. They lived in a tent two blocks east of Pablo Historical Park. A second tent was the general store and post office. On August 22, 1884, Mrs. Scull was appointed postmaster. Mail was dispatched by horse and buggy up the beach to Mayport, and from there to Jacksonville by steamer. The Sculls built the first house in 1884 on their tent site. The settlement was named Ruby for their first daughter. On May 13, 1886, the town was renamed Pablo Beach after the San Pablo River. In 1885, the San Pablo Diego Beach Land Co. sold town lots ranging from $50 to $100 each along with lots from $10 to $20 per acre within of the new seaside resort \"Pablo Beach\". In September 1892, work on the wagon road to Pablo Beach (Atlantic Boulevard) was begun. The first resort hotel called the Murray Hall Hotel was established in mid 1886 but on August 7, 1890 it was destroyed in a fire. By 1900 the railway company began to have financial difficulties and Henry Flagler took over as part of his Florida East Coast Railway. In late 1900 the railway was changed to standard gauge and was extended to Mayport.\nThe Spanish\u2013American War broke out in 1898. The 3rd Nebraska arrived July 22, 1898, for training and embarkation. They encamped at Pablo Beach. They were led by three-time presidential candidate, William Jennings Bryan. After flooding in the camp at Pablo Beach the 3rd Nebraska moved to downtown Jacksonville.\nThe amusement park phase of Jacksonville Beach began in 1905 with The Pavilion which was later expanded and called Little Coney Island. It was a popular tourist attraction that had such entertainment as a dance floor, swim room, bowling alley, and roller skate rinks. An issue with contracting and constant weathering of its wooden structure aged Little Coney Island causing it to be torn down in 1925. On June 15, 1925, the name Pablo Beach was changed to Jacksonville Beach. The Shad's Pier was created in 1922 by Charles Shad and with help by Martin Williams. Around the same time W. H. Adams, Sr. created the Ocean View Pavilion amusement park on the former site of the Murray Hall Hotel. Adams wanted to create a larger roller coaster than the one at Little Coney Island. His vision resulted in a 93-feet high coaster. The location of the coaster by the beach made it vulnerable to damage and was eventually deemed unsafe. The coaster was then deconstructed to a smaller coaster. The deconstruction of the larger coaster hurt business at the amusement park. By 1949 the Ocean View Pavilion was in decline and then a fire destroyed it a few years later. The only amusement park in Jacksonville Beach today is Adventure Landing. The boardwalk declined in the 1950s due to the crackdown on gambling and games of chance. Driving on the beach was prohibited in 1979.\nPablo Beach made aviation history on February 24, 1921, Lt. Wm. DeVoe Coney, in a transcontinental flight from San Diego, California, landed at Pablo Beach, having made the flight in 22 hours and 17 minutes, beating the old record, set two years earlier, by 3 hours and 32 minutes. Coney's record was soon eclipsed on September 5, 1922, by Jimmy Doolittle piloting a De Havilland DH-4 biplane from Pablo Beach to San Diego in an elapsed time of 21 hours and 19 minutes.\nIn 1968 most residents of Duval County voted to approve consolidation between the county and the City of Jacksonville. Jacksonville Beach, together with Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, and the Westside community of Baldwin voted to retain their own municipal governments. As such they are not part of the City of Jacksonville, but receive county-level services from Jacksonville, and vote for Jacksonville's mayor and City Council. Judy Van Zant, widow of lead singer of Lynyrd Skynyrd Ronnie Van Zant, and her daughter Melody opened the Freebird Cafe in 1999. Freebird Live, as it later became, was a popular music venue that became a staple for Jacksonville Beach for 16 years until its closure in 2016. In September 1999 Hurricane Floyd destroyed the Jacksonville Beach Pier. Five years later the pier was rebuilt. In October 2016 Hurricane Matthew forced a mandatory evacuation for Jacksonville Beach. Hurricane Matthew came 40 miles off the coast of Jacksonville Beach causing major flooding. The Jacksonville Beach Pier was partially destroyed by Hurricane Matthew.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it (66.61%) is water. Jacksonville Beach is the largest town in the Jacksonville Beaches community. It is the eastern terminus of U.S. Route 90, which ends at an intersection with State Road A1A three blocks from the Atlantic Ocean. The city is located at (30.284091, -81.396074).\nIn general, the architecture of Jacksonville varies in style and is not defined by any one characteristic, and Jacksonville Beach is no exception. Designed by Marsh and Saxelbye, and completed in 1925, Casa Marina Hotel is a Mission style hotel popular in the 1920s when Jacksonville's beaches were being developed. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 2, 1993. Constructed in 1947, the American Red Cross Volunteer Life Saving Corps Station is an Art Moderne style lifeguard station designed by local architect Jefferson Davis Powell. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 5, 2014. Jacksonville Beach is also home to a notable collection of Mid-Century modern architecture. Perhaps the most notable of these works are those designed by architect William Morgan.\nHanna Park is a public beach and city park located near Mayport in the Jacksonville Beaches area. It consists of of mature coastal hammock, and was formerly known as Manhattan Beach, Florida's first beach community for African Americans during the period of segregation in the United States.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 20,990 people, 9,715 households, and 5,207 families residing in the city.

For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 99.7 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $46,922, and the median income for a family was $58,388 (these figures had risen to $62,897 and $80,054 respectively as of a 2007 estimate). Males had a median income of $36,385 versus $30,055 for females. The per capita income for the city was $27,467. About 4.2% of families and 7.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.2% of those under age 18 and 7.0% of those age 65 or over.\nSince the 1968 consolidation between Duval County and the City of Jacksonville, Jacksonville Beach has been a separate municipality within the consolidated city of Jacksonville. As such, it has its own city manager, city council, and mayor, but it is subject to county-level governance by Jacksonville. The current mayor is Charlie Latham who was re-elected to a second four-year term in November 2016.\nBeach Boulevard (US 90) connects Jacksonville Beach to the Southside neighborhood of Jacksonville. It continues westward to downtown Jacksonville, via the Commodore Point Expressway and Hart Bridge. Butler Bouleveard (SR 202) begins in southeast Jacksonville at Philips Highway (US 1) and ends in southern Jacksonville Beach at 3rd Street South (SR A1A). SR A1A is a popular seaside scenic route extending from Fernandina Beach to Key West. In Jacksonville Beach it serves as the main commercial corridor, extending the length of the beachside community.\nThe Duval County Public Schools district operates public schools, including San Pablo Elementary School in Jacksonville Beach.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 392, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 392, "length": 1797, "sectionHeading": "History | Pablo Beach", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2189, "length": 2908, "sectionHeading": "History | Jacksonville Beach", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5097, "length": 379, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5476, "length": 822, "sectionHeading": "Geography | Architecture", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6298, "length": 292, "sectionHeading": "Geography | Parks and recreation", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6590, "length": 1727, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 8317, "length": 403, "sectionHeading": "Government", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 8720, "length": 555, "sectionHeading": "Transportation", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 9275, "length": 127, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almer\u00eda", "type": "city", "title": "Almer\u00eda", "abstract": "Almer\u00eda ( ; ] , ] ) is a city in Andalusia, Spain, located in the southeast of Spain on the Mediterranean Sea, and is the capital of the province of the same name. It was Abd-ar-Rahman III who founded the Alcazaba (the Citadel), which gave this city its name: Al-Mari'yah (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0651\u0629, the Watchtower). In the 10th and 11th centuries, it formed part of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, and grew wealthy on trade and the textile industry, especially silk. It suffered many sieges and fell under Christian domination in 1489. In 1522, Almer\u00eda was devastated by an earthquake and rebuilding and recovery didn't really get underway until the 19th century. During the Spanish Civil War, the city was shelled by the German Navy, and fell to Franco in 1939. It has since rebuilt its economy around vegetable production, with 100,000 acres of greenhouses, supplying much of Europe.\n", "text": "In the first century, Christian documents report that there was a town named Urci, possibly near the current site of Almer\u00eda, in the Hispania of the Roman Empire. However, this is disputed, as there are several possible sites of the town. However, missionary Saint Indaletius is said to have evangelized Urci and become its first bishop, and is officially the patron saint of Almer\u00eda.\nLater, the city was refounded by Calipha Abd-ar-Rahman III of C\u00f3rdoba in 955 AD. It was to be a principal harbour in his extensive domain to strengthen his Mediterranean defences.\nIts Moorish castle, the Alcazaba of Almer\u00eda, is the second largest among the Muslim fortresses of Andalusia, after the Alhambra.\nIn this period, the port city of Almer\u00eda reached its historical peak. After the fragmentation of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba in 1031, Almer\u00eda continued to be ruled by powerful local Muslim Taifa emirs like Jairan, the first independent Emir of Almer\u00eda and Cartagena, and Almotacin, the poet emir. Both Jairan and Almotacin were fearless warriors, but also sophisticated patrons of the arts. A silk industry, based upon plantings of mulberry trees in the hot, dry landscape of the province, supported Almer\u00eda in the 11th century and made its strategic harbour an even more valuable asset.\nContested by the emirs of Granada and Valencia, Almer\u00eda experienced many sieges, including one especially fierce siege when Christians, called to the Second Crusade by Pope Eugene III, were also encouraged to attack the Muslim 'infidels' on a more familiar coast. On that occasion Alfonso VII, starting on 11 July 1147, at the head of mixed forces of Catalans, Genoese, Pisans and Franks, led a crusade against the rich city, and Almer\u00eda was occupied on 17 October 1147. \nWithin a decade, however, Almer\u00eda had passed to the control of the puritanical Muslim Almoravid emirs, and not until the late 15th century did it fall permanently into Christian hands. The city surrendered to the Catholic Monarchs, Fernando and Isabel, on December 26, 1489.\nThe 16th century was for Almer\u00eda a century of natural and human catastrophes; for there were at least four earthquakes, of which the one in 1522 was especially violent, devastating the city. The people who had remained Muslim were expelled from Almer\u00eda after the War of Las Alpujarras in 1568 and scattered across Spain. Landings and attacks by Berber pirates were also frequent in the 16th century, and continued until the early 18th century. At that time, huge iron mines were discovered and French and British companies set up business in the area, bringing renewed prosperity and returning Almer\u00eda to a position of relative importance within Spain. \nDuring the Spanish Civil War the city was shelled by the German Navy, with news reaching the London and Parisian press about the \"criminal bombardment of Almer\u00eda by German planes\". Almer\u00eda surrendered in 1939, being the last Andalusian capital city to fall to Francoist forces.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Almer\u00eda witnessed spectacular economic growth due to tourism and intensive agriculture, with crops grown year-round in massive invernaderos \u2013 plastic-covered \"greenhouses\" \u2013 for intensive vegetable production.\nAfter Franco's death and popular approval of the new Spanish Constitution, the people of southern Spain were called on to approve an autonomous status for the region in a referendum. While the referendum were approved with 118,186 votes for and 11,092 votes against in Almer\u00eda province, an absolute majority of all 279,300 registered electors was needed, and the result in Almer\u00eda was just 42%. The Government impugned the result, and Almer\u00eda remained part of the present autonomous region of Andalusia.\nAlmeria has the highest proportion of Muslim population of any Spanish city at 11-20%, depending on source. \nFamous natives of Almer\u00eda include Nicol\u00e1s Salmer\u00f3n y Alonso, who in 1873 was the third president of the First Spanish Republic, as well as several musicians, including the composer Jos\u00e9 Padilla S\u00e1nchez, whose music was declared of \"universal interest\" by Unesco in 1989, the popular folk singer Manolo Escobar, renowned Flamenco guitar player Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s \"Tomatito\" and Grammy Award winner David Bisbal; the champion motorcyclist Antonio Maeso moved to Almer\u00eda as a child.\nThe Irish folk-rock group The Pogues paid tribute to Almeria in \"Fiesta,\" a rollicking Spike Jones-flavored song on the band's third album, If I Should Fall From Grace with God.\nAlmer\u00eda hosted the Mediterranean Games in 2005. The city has 2 football teams: UD Almer\u00eda, which plays in the Spanish Segunda Divisi\u00f3n following relegation from La Liga in 2013 and CP Almer\u00eda, in regional division.\nThe economy of Almer\u00eda is mostly based on agriculture, which is located mainly in the western part of the region. Numerous greenhouses mostly constructed with plasticulture produce tonnes of fruit and vegetables, more than 70% of their product being exported to the rest of Europe. These greenhouses are controversial, with allegations of cheap labor and harsh conditions. The plastic often ends up the sea, killing marine life.\nBy land, Almer\u00eda can be reached by the A-7 Mediterranean Highway, which connects the Mediterranean area with the Spanish A-92 that unites it with the rest of Andalusia.\nBy sea, the port of Almer\u00eda has connections to Melilla, Algeria, Morocco, and tourist cruises in the Mediterranean. It also has a marina with moorings for pleasure boats. Currently the port of Almer\u00eda is being expanded with new docks and transformed into a container port to take large-scale international shipping and thereby increase its freight traffic. It normally connects with the following destinations:\n- Acciona: Ghazaouet (Algeria), Oran (Algeria), Nador (Morocco) and Melilla.\n- Comarit: Nador.\n- Comanav: Nador.\nBy air, Almer\u00eda is served by Almer\u00eda Airport, the fourth largest in Andalusia with domestic and international connections to Amsterdam, Madrid, Barcelona, Melilla, London, Manchester, Birmingham, Brussels, Dublin and Swiss, German and other EU airports.\nDue to its arid landscape, numerous spaghetti westerns were filmed in Almer\u00eda and some of the sets are still remain as a tourist attraction.\nThese sets are located in the desert of Tabernas. The town and region were also used by David Lean in Lawrence of Arabia (1962), John Milius in The Wind and the Lion (1975) and others.\nOne of Almer\u00eda's most famous natural spots is the Cabo de Gata-N\u00edjar Natural Park. This park is of volcanic origin, and is the largest and most ecologically significant marine-terrestrial space in the European Western Mediterranean Sea.\nWith one of the most beautiful and ecologically rich coasts of the western Mediterranean and an area of 380 square kilometres it is one of Spain\u2019s natural jewels. \nThe Cabo de Gata-N\u00edjar Natural Park runs through the municipal areas of N\u00edjar, Almerimar and Carboneras. Its villages, previously dedicated to fishing, have become tourism spots for those interested in nature. One of the greatest attractions of the Cabo de Gata-N\u00edjar Natural Park is its beaches.\nWith a yearly precipitation of just and with only 26 days of precipitation, Almer\u00eda is the only city in Europe with a true hot desert climate (BWh) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, although it borders a hot semi-arid climate (BSh). Almer\u00eda is the only European city with this type of climate, also being one of the driest zones on both shores of the Mediterranean coast. Almer\u00eda has an annual temperature of \nThe BWh climate is present in nearby areas of Almer\u00eda province (such as the Cabo de Gata-N\u00edjar Natural Park, the Andarax/Almanzora river valleys), the only region in Europe to have this climate. With an average annual temperature above , it also qualifies as the 2nd warmest city in continental Europe, after Seville, also in Andalusia, Spain. This climatic region spreads along the coastline around Almeria, from approximately Almerimar to the southwest, to Torrevieja to the northeast. The nearby Faro del Cabo has the lowest annual precipitation on the European continent (156mm per year).\nAlmeria also experiences the warmest winters of any city on the European continent with a population over 100,000, and hot and dry summers with no precipitation between June and August. Almer\u00eda enjoys about 2994 hours of sunshine annually with over 320 sunny days a year on average (6 hours of sunshine in January and 12 in July), making Almer\u00eda the sunniest city in Europe.\nAlmer\u00eda is unique, for a city in Continental Europe, for not having any registered temperature under the freezing mark in its recorded weather history. The coldest temperature recorded was on 9 February 1935. The city of Almer\u00eda has a very warm climate for its latitude, as it has a very similar climate to Alexandria, in Egypt, which is located further south at 31\u00baN latitude.\nDuring the winter, daily maximum temperatures tend to stay around . At night, the temperature very rarely drops below . The dry season (although there is no real wet season) occurs during the hottest months, as in the Mediterranean climate. Due to the fact there is no real wet season, precipitation even during the wettest months is rare, this falls in short showers or thunderstorms, most likely due to the rain shadow effect. Inland areas of the Almer\u00eda province have reached in summer.\nDuring the warmest months - July and August, the sky is clear and sunny and no rainfall occurs. The typical daily temperatures are around during the heat of the day often rising to or higher. The minimum temperatures stay around during July and August. As is the case for most of coastal Iberia, heatwaves in Almer\u00eda are less common than in the interior; The hottest temperature recorded was in August 2011.\nIn 2000, a team of geologists found a cave filled with giant gypsum crystals in an abandoned silver mine near Almer\u00eda. The cavity, which measures 8 x 1.8 x 1.7 metres, may be the largest geode ever found. The entrance of the cave has been blocked by five tons of rocks, and is under police protection (to prevent looters from entering). According to geological models, the cave was formed during the Messinian salinity crisis 6 million years ago, when the Mediterranean sea evaporated and left thick layers of salt sediments (evaporites). The cave is currently not accessible to tourists.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 3712, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3712, "length": 109, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3821, "length": 650, "sectionHeading": "People and culture", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4471, "length": 215, "sectionHeading": "People and culture | Sports", "sectionLabel": "city.sport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4686, "length": 429, "sectionHeading": "Economy", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5115, "length": 947, "sectionHeading": "Transport", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6062, "length": 1024, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7086, "length": 2668, "sectionHeading": "Climate", "sectionLabel": "city.climate"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 9754, "length": 589, "sectionHeading": "Crystal cave", "sectionLabel": "city.other"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulan-Ude", "type": "city", "title": "Ulan-Ude", "abstract": "Ulan-Ude (Russian: ; , Ulaan \u00dcde) is the capital city of the Republic of Buryatia, Russia; it is located about southeast of Lake Baikal on the Uda River at its confluence with the Selenga.

From around 1735, the settlement was called Udinsk ( ) and was granted town status under that name in 1775. The name was changed to Verkhneudinsk, literally \"Upper Udinsk\" ( ) in 1783, to differentiate it from Nizhneudinsk (\"Lower Udinsk\") lying on a different Uda River near Irkutsk which was granted town status that year. The \"upper\" and \"lower\" refer to positions of the two cities relative to each other, not the location of the cities on their respective Uda rivers. Verkhneudinsk lies at the mouth of its Uda, i.e. the lower end, while Nizhneudinsk is along the middle stretch of its Uda. The current name was given to the city July 27, 1934 and means \"red Uda\" in Buryat, reflecting the Soviet Union's Communist ideology.\nUlan-Ude lies east of Moscow and southeast of Lake Baikal. It is above sea level at the foot of the Khamar-Daban and Khrebet Ulan-Burgasy mountain ranges, next to the confluence of the Selenga River and its tributary, the Uda, which divides the city.\nUlan-Ude is one of the few pairs of cities in the world that has a near-exact antipodal city \u2014 with Puerto Natales, Chile.\nThere are two rivers that flows across Ulan-Ude \u2014 Selenga and Uda.\nSelenga is the biggest inflow of Baikal Lake, supplying 50% of all rivers in its basin. Selenga brings into the lake about of water per year, exerting a major influence on the formation of the lake water and its sanitary condition. Selenga is the habitat of the most valuable fish species such as Omul, Siberian sturgeon, Siberian taimen, Thymallus and Coregonus.\nUda is the right inflow of the Selenga river. The length of the watercourse is .\nThe first occupants of the area where Ulan-Ude now stands were the Evenks and, later, the Buryat Mongols. Ulan-Ude was settled in 1666 by the Russian Cossacks as the fortress of Udinskoye. Due to its favorable geographical position, it grew rapidly and became a large trade center which connected Russia with China and Mongolia and, from 1690, was the administrative center of the Transbaikal region. By 1775, it was known as Udinsk, and in 1783 it was granted city status and renamed Verkhneudinsk. After a large fire in 1878, the city was almost completely rebuilt. The Trans-Siberian Railway reached the city in 1900 causing an explosion in growth. The population which was 3,500 in 1880 reached 126,000 in 1939.\nFrom April 6 to October 1920 Verkhneudinsk was the capital of the Far Eastern Republic (\u0414\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430), sometimes called Chita Republic. It was a nominally independent state that existed from April 1920 to November 1922 in the easternmost part of the Russian Far East.\nOn July 27, 1934, the city was renamed Ulan-Ude. \nUlan-Ude is the capital of the republic. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the city of republic significance of Ulan-Ude\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of republic significance of Ulan-Ude is incorporated as Ulan-Ude Urban Okrug.\nAccording to the 2010 Census, 404,426 people lived in Ulan-Ude; up from 359,391 recorded in the 2002 Census. In terms of population, it is the third largest city in eastern Siberia.\nThe ethnic makeup of the city's population in 2002: \n- Russians: 73.1%\n- Buryats: 21.4%\n- Ukrainians: 2.6%\n- Tatars: 0.8%\n- Others: 2.1%\nThe city is the center of Tibetan Buddhism in Russia and the important Ivolginsky datsan is located from the city.\nUlan-Ude is located on the main line (Trans-Siberian line) of the Trans-Siberian Railway between Irkutsk and Chita at the junction of the Trans-Mongolian line (the Trans-Mongolian Railway) which begins at Ulan Ude and continues south through Mongolia to Beijing in China. The city also lies on the M55 section of the Baikal Highway (part of the Trans-Siberian Highway), the main federal road to Vladivostok. Air traffic is served by the Ulan-Ude Airport (Baikal), as well as the smaller Ulan-Ude Vostochny Airport. Intracity transport includes tram, bus, and marshrutka (share taxi) lines.\nUntil 1991, Ulan-Ude was closed to foreigners. There are old merchants' mansions richly decorated with wood and stone carving in the historical center of Ulan-Ude, along the river banks which are exceptional examples of Russian classicism. The city has a large ethnographic museum which recalls the history of the peoples of the region.\nThere is a large and highly unusual statue of the head of Vladimir Lenin in the central square: the largest in the world. Built in 1970 for the centennial of Lenin's birth, it towers over the main plaza at and weighs 42 tons. The head has avoided the patina associated with bronze by a special coating and is a common meeting place.\nOther attractions are Geser, a monument, and the King's Gate arch.\nThe Ethnographic Museum of the peoples of Transbaikal is one of Russia's largest open-air museums. The museum contains historical finds from the era of the Slab Grave Culture and the Xiongnu until the mid 20th century, including a unique collection of samples of wooden architecture of Siberia - more than forty architectural monuments.\nOdigitrievsky Cathedral - Orthodox Church Diocese of the Buryat, was the first stone building in the city and is a Siberian baroque architectural monument. The cathedral is considered unique because it is built in a zone of high seismic activity in the heart of the city on the banks of the River Uda River where it flows into the Selenga.\nOne of the attractions of Ulan-Ude is a monument in the town square \u2014 the square of the Soviets \u2014 in the form of the head of Lenin (sculptors G.V. Neroda, J.G. Neroda, architects Dushkin, P.G. Zilberman). The monument, weighing 42 tons and with a height of , was opened in 1971 in honor of the centenary of Lenin's birth.\nUlan-Ude can be described as possessing a very continental steppe climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSk), bordering on a humid continental climate (Dwb). The climate is characterised by long, dry, cold winters and short but very warm summers.

The population was 11,986 at the 2010 Census. It is the county seat of Howell County.\n", "text": "The history of West Plains can be traced back to 1832, when settler Josiah Howell (after whom Howell County is named) created the first settlement in the region known as Howell Valley. West Plains was so named because the settlement was on a prairie in a westerly direction from the nearest town, Thomasville.\nThe Courthouse Square Historic District, Elledge Arcade Buildings, International Shoe Company Building, Mount Zion Lodge Masonic Temple, W. J. and Ed Smith Building, and West Plains Bank Building are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe location of West Plains led to nearly constant conflict due to the proximity to what was then the border between the Union and Confederacy. West Plains was largely burned to the ground, and Howell County as a whole was devastated. No major battles occurred in West Plains or Howell County, but much of the devastation came from constant guerrilla warfare.\nConfederate Brigadier General James Haggin McBride gave residents an ultimatum to either join the Confederate army or to flee the area. An overwhelming majority of Howell County residents chose to flee, and over 90% of the population had fled by the time the war was over. Many, however, also chose to fight for the Confederacy, as McBride promised to protect his soldiers' property and loved ones. Men who spoke out against the Confederacy were arrested, as martial law had been declared by McBride. Though Howell County was in Union-controlled Missouri, it was easily within Confederate control due to its position on the Arkansas border.\nAs was the case with many other locations, the Great Depression hit West Plains in the 1930s. Citizens had little knowledge of what was going on with the national scene, except for what Neathery says in his book, \"every place was a boom town, [but] in some places things were going bust as well.\" The first bank to fail in West Plains was the Farmers Savings Bank in West Plains circa 1926, and the lack of the present-day Federal Deposit Insurance Company meant that some people initially lost whatever wealth was deposited.\nOn April 13, 1928, for reasons still unknown, a violent explosion occurred in downtown West Plains. About 60 people had gathered in the Bond Dance Hall, which was on the second floor of a building on East Main Street. The explosion was reported to be felt for miles, even in Pomona, which is approximately ten miles from West Plains. Windows were shattered throughout the block, and cars were also warped on the street. The explosion also damaged the nearby Howell County Courthouse so badly that it was vacated and left until late 1933, when it was demolished by the Civil Works Administration. 37 people were killed in the explosion, and 22 people were injured. 20 of those killed were never positively identified and buried in a mass grave at Oak Lawn Cemetery in the southeast part of town. Today, they are memorialized by the Rock of Ages monument, erected on October 6, 1929. The explosion has also been remembered in a folk song recorded 30 years later.\nThe cause of the explosion is still a topic of controversy nearly a century after the blast. Numerous causes for the explosion have been offered, but a definitive story has never been proven to be true. The most widely accepted theory is that the explosion somehow originated from leaking gasoline in a garage owned by J. W. Wiser, which happened to be on the floor below. Because Wiser was at the garage at the time, some have speculated that the blast was intentionally caused by Wiser as a suicide attempt, which his wife reportedly refused to acknowledge. In addition, the late West Plains native Robert Neathery explained in his 1994 book, West Plains As I Knew It, that a truck containing dynamite parked in the garage may have been the cause, indirectly part of a crime in which someone shot Wiser and set a fire to cover up the crime, and the dynamite exploded.\nThe event is fictionalized in the short novel The Maid's Version by Daniel Woodrell, which is about a similar dance hall explosion in the fictional town of West Table.\nOn Friday evening, April 2, 1982, a long-track F4 tornado struck the West Plains area, beginning in Ozark County and ending near what was the airport at the time. Many homes and businesses were significantly damaged or leveled by the tornado, which killed 3 and injured at least 28 as it hit the West Plains Country Club and nearby homes, as well as businesses located on U.S. Route 63.\nThe downtown area of West Plains, namely Court Square, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 17, 2003.

It is one of the oldest towns in the Rio Grande Valley, and the city celebrated its centennial in 2007.\nThe city was located in Capisallo Pasture, part of Capisallo Ranch owned by Jim Welles. This location was known as the Pear Orchard because of the vast numbers of prickly pear cactus growing there at that time.\nSome sources state that the original name given to the city was Diaz in honor of Porfirio Diaz, then president of Mexico. Later it was renamed Mercedes Diaz in honor of the president's wife and from that, Mercedes became the Queen City. This story, however, is historically inaccurate, given that neither of Diaz's two wives were named Mercedes.\nGeneral Zachary Taylor's headquarters was to the southeast of Mercedes near the river. There the old Rabb Ranch was famous for its stagecoach stop and riverboat landing for the riverboats that plied the Rio Grande carrying supplies to the settlements and military installations.\nThe old Toluca Ranch still stands east of the International Bridge at Progreso, the sister city to the south. This ranch was close to the river and a prized target for the bandidos during the days of Pancho Villa.

The population was 5,770 at the 2010 census.\nOn December 29, 1856, Dr. Richard Rodgers Peebles and James W. McDade organized the Hempstead Town Company to sell lots in the newly established community of Hempstead, which was located at the projected terminus of Houston and Texas Central Railway. Peebles named Hempstead after Dr. G. S. B. Hempstead, Peebles's brother-in-law. Peebles and Mary Ann Groce Peebles, his wife, contributed of the estate of Jared E. Groce, Jr., for the community. On June 29, 1858, the Houston and Texas Central Railway was extended to Hempstead, causing the community to become a distribution center between the Gulf Coast and the interior of Texas. On November 10 of that year, Hempstead incorporated. The Washington County Railroad, which ran from Hempstead to Brenham, enhanced the city upon its completion.\nThe Confederate Military Post of Hempstead was established in the Spring 1861. Numerous camps of instruction were established east of town along Clear Creek. Camp Hebert CSA was established on the eastern bank of Clear Creek and south of the Washington Road. Camp Hebert was the earliest camp in the area, and served as the headquarters of the Post of Hempstead early in the war.\nCamp Groce CSA was established in the Spring of 1862 on Liendo Plantation on the eastern bank of Clear Creek as a Camp of Instruction for Confederate Infantry Recruits. Originally named, \"Camp Liendo\", the name was changed to honor Leonard Waller Groce, the owner of Liendo Plantation, and the owner of over 100 slaves. A contract to construct the barracks at Camps Groce and Hebert was let in February 1862. Numerous Confederate infantry regiments were organized, trained, and equipped at Camps Groce and Hebert. In the Spring of 1862, the camps were abandoned due to their sickly locations. Camp Groce was reused as a military camp until the Spring of 1863, but was again abandoned. From 1861 to 1863, nearly 200 Confederate Soldiers fell sick at Camps Groce and Hebert and died. Many were taken to the Post Hospital in the Planter's Exchange Hotel located at the southwest corner of 12th & Wilkins St. in downtown Hempstead. Many died in the hospital and almost all of them are buried on McDade Plantation west of town, which became the hospital cemetery.\nIn June 1863, Camp Groce was re-opened as a prison camp for Union prisoners captured in the Battles of Galveston (January 1, 1863) and Sabine Pass I (January 21, 1863). The Union prisoners of war taken at the Battle of Sabine Pass II (September 8, 1863) were also sent to Camp Groce. 427 Union prisoners were held at Camp Groce in 1863 and 21 died. Most of the dead were buried 1/4 northeast of camp where most of them still rest today.\nCamp Groce was re-opened in May 1864 for 148 Union prisoners captured at the battle of Calcasieu Pass, La. The group of prisoners included the crew of the USS Granite City and USS Wave, Tinclad #45, and 37 Soldiers. About 40 Soldiers from the 1st Texas US Cavalry were sent to Camp Groce in June 1864, and 506 more Union Prisoners were transferred to Camp Groce from Camp Ford in August 1864. Yellow Fever and other terrible diseases prevailed on the prisoners. They were moved to Camp Gillespie near Bellville in late September 1864 and then to Camp Felder, 6.5 miles north northwest of Chappell Hill, Texas. 221 prisoners died or are missing from Camps Groce, Gillespie, and Felder in 1864. 444 were paroled in December 1864.\nAbout 8,000 Confederate Soldiers were ordered to Hempstead in the Spring of 1865. They were waiting for Confederate President Jefferson Davis to arrive to make the Last Stand of the Confederacy. Davis was captured in Georgia and Confederate General Kirby Smith surrendered the Department of the Trans-Mississippi on May 24, 1865. All Confederate forces in Hempstead and all other CS posts in Texas simply went home. Immediately after the surrender of CS forces, it took about a month before US troops entered the state. The first US forces that arrived in Hempstead after the war was the 29th Illinois Volunteer Infantry. \nIn August 1865, Maj. Gen. George A. Custer arrived in Hempstead with a division of volunteer US cavalry. The division camped in and around Liendo Plantation for about 2 months before moving to Austin or were mustered out of the service at Hempstead in 1865-66. The cavalry regiments under the command of Custer at Hempstead were the 1st Iowa, 2nd Wisconsin, 7th Indiana, and the 5th and 12th Illinois Cavalry. Company K of the 37th Illinois Volunteer Infantry occupied the town and guarded the railroad line until the regiment was mustered out in May 1866. The headquarters of US Post of Hempstead was located in town and not at Liendo Plantation.\nUS Forces fanned out and set up camps in numerous towns. Their mission was to parole former Confederate troops, collect CS property, and to establish law and order. Many former CS troops did not report for their paroles, however, and many went to Mexico. The volunteer US regiments stationed in Texas were nearly gone from the state by the end of 1865.\nIn 1867, the 1st Battalion, Companies A and B of the 17th US Infantry, were stationed at Hempstead. The battalion had arrived for duty in Hempstead the fall of 1866. They set up camp 1/4 north of the US Post Office. Their mission was primarily in support of the Freedmen's Bureau. In the fall of 1867, a terrible Yellow Fever epidemic devastated the civilian population of Hempstead, and nearly 40 soldiers of the 17th US Infantry perished as well.\n1863: 427 POWs, 21 died, 2 escaped\n1864: 683 POWs, 147 died, 28 missing, 18 escaped, 13 deserted to the enemy, 14 status unknown, and 1 political prisoner held by CS authorities until released in May 1865.\nTotals: 1,110 POWs held, 168 died, 28 missing, 20 escaped, 13 deserted to the enemy, 14 status unknown\nAt least 225 Confederate Soldiers died or are missing from in and around Hempstead, Texas during the Civil War.\nMost of the US and CS Soldiers who died in and around Hempstead, Texas during the Civil War are still buried in the area. They are buried in 3 primary locations in and around Camp Groce and west of town on the old McDade Plantation Cemetery on Austin Branch Road near Sorsby Road. There is a Texas State Historical Marker there entitled, \"Union Army POW Cemetery,\" but there are also numerous US Navy POWs buried there along with numerous Confederate Soldiers who died in the hospitals in downtown Hempstead. It is worth noting that 99 US Navy POWs died while held at Camp Sumpter, Andersonville, Ga., and 75 died while held at Camps Groce, Felder, Hempstead, and Houston.\nHempstead is famous for its watermelon crop, and until the 1940s, the town was the top shipper of watermelons in the United States. Billy DiIorio was known as the Watermelon King and Angelina DiIorio was known as the Watermelon Queen. Both resided in Hempstead, Texas. The town holds an annual Watermelon Festival in July.\nThe town has grown in recent years because of its relative closeness to Houston along U.S. Highway 290. The current economy is based on county government, shipping, and a small but growing industrial base. However, the closing of a large auto dealership (Lawerence Marshall) in 2009 hurt the community's economy and correlated with a drop in the town's population. The town has, however, rebounded in its population since 2010.\nOne of the town's residents was Lillie E. Drennan, who in 1929 became the first woman to hold a commercial driver's license in Texas. She ran a regional hauling company called the Drennan Truck Line while maintaining an excellent driving record.

Pilot George W. Thompson made a few flights in a Mathewson biplane and performed tricks. Thousands of people from cities in a 100 mile radius came to see the event. \nIn 1974, U.S. psychologist ElDean Kohrs used the town as the basic example of what he called the 'Gillette Syndrome': the social disruption that can occur in a community due to rapid population growth. During the 1960s, Gillette doubled its population from 3,580 to 7,194 residents. Kohrs proposed that this fast increase of population caused the phenomenon known as Gillette Syndrome, resulting in increased crime, high costs of living and weakened social and community bonds. Some of Kohrs claims were later proven wrong in Gillette Syndrome A myth revisited? by James G. Thompson.

The population was 13,040 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Beaumont\u2013Port Arthur Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n", "text": "The area known as Port Neches was once inhabited by tribes of the coastal-dwelling Karankawa and Atakapa Native Americans. Smith\u2019s Bluff (the future site of Sun Oil and Union Oil of California riverside property) and Grigsby\u2019s Bluff (now Port Neches) were the only two high land bluffs on the Neches River south of Beaumont. Before 1780, Grigsby\u2019s Bluff, explicitly that part of Port Neches immediately east of Port Neches Park, had been a Native American town for at least 1,500 years, at first of the Karankawa tribe, whose 7-foot skeletons were often found in the burial mounds there; and after 1650 of the Nacazils, a sub-tribe of the Attakapas, who were a short and stocky people before their extinction about 1780. As of 1841, there were six large burial mounds at Grigsby\u2019s Bluff, size about 60 feet wide, 20 feet tall, and 100 yards long, consisting entirely of clam and sea shells, skeletons, pottery shards, and other Native American artifacts. Between 1841 and 1901, all six of the mounds disappeared, a result of human actions. Grigsby\u2019s Bluff became a post office in 1859 (there was also a store and sawmill there), but the office was discontinued in 1893. The city of Port Neches was later incorporated in 1902.\nPort Neches was also the site of Fort Grigsby, a set of American Civil War-era defenses intended to stop a Union advance up the Neches River. The fort was constructed in October 1862, and abandoned sometime after July 1863. Its guns, munitions, and stores were moved to the then-unfinished Fort Griffin, the site of the famous Second Battle of Sabine Pass, often credited as the most one-sided Confederate victory of the American Civil War.\nOver 130 years later, Her Majesty Beatrix, Queen of the Netherlands, appointed W. T. Block Jr. (his son) as \"Knight of the Royal Order of Orange-Nassau\" in a ceremony held at the Tex Ritter Park in Nederland, Texas. The award was presented by the Consul General of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. W.T. Block, Jr. is known for his work in reconstructing the history of Dutch settlers in the Port Neches areas.\nThrough its history, beginning in 1834 as Grigsby's Bluff and continuing after its incorporation in 1902, the City of Port Neches has had a special relationship with the natural environment, particularly the Neches River. From agriculture and timber to oil and synthetics, the City has depended heavily on the river as its lifeline. Today, the greater Neches River Basin is an international attraction for \"experiential\" tourism; whether that might be fishing, hunting, birding, boating or many other out-door experiences that are abundant and readily available.\nThe Oak Bluff cemetery, located near the river, is the burial site of famed country music singer and actor Tex Ritter.\nPort Neches is located 20 miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico.\nPort Neches is located at (29.980863, -93.960382).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (0.76%) is water.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 13,601 people, 5,280 households, and 3,975 families residing in the city.

The racial makeup of the city was 94.75% White, 0.93% African American, 0.47% Native American, 1.57% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 1.18% from other races, and 1.09% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.07% of the population.\nThere were 5,280 households out of which 34.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 61.6% were married couples living together, 10.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.7% were non-families. 21.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.57 and the average family size was 3.00.\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 25.5% under the age of 18, 8.9% from 18 to 24, 26.9% from 25 to 44, 24.3% from 45 to 64, and 14.3% who were 65 years of age or older.

It is the administrative capital of the Province of Como.\nIts proximity to Lake Como and to the Alps has made Como a tourist destination and the city contains numerous works of art, churches, gardens, museums, theatres, parks and palaces: the Duomo (seat of Diocese of Como), the Basilica of Sant'Abbondio, the Villa Olmo, the public gardens with the Tempio Voltiano, the Teatro Sociale, the Broletto (the city's medieval town hall) and the 20th century Casa del Fascio.\nWith 215,320 overnight guests, in 2013 Como was the fourth most visited city in Lombardy after Milan, Bergamo and Brescia.\nComo was the birthplace of many historical figures, including the poet Caecilius mentioned by Catullus in the 1st century BCE, writers Pliny the Elder and the Younger, Pope Innocent XI, scientist Alessandro Volta, and Cosima Liszt, second wife of Richard Wagner and long-term director of the Bayreuth Festival.\n", "text": "The hills surrounding the current location of Como have been inhabited, since at least the Bronze Age, by a Celtic tribe known as the Orobii. Remains of settlements are still present on the wood covered hills to the South West of town.\nAround the 1st century BC, the territory became subject to the Romans. The town center was situated on the nearby hills, but it was then moved to its current location by order of Julius Caesar, who had the swamp near the southern tip of the lake drained and laid the plan of the walled city in the typical Roman grid of perpendicular streets. The newly founded town was named Novum Comum and had the status of municipium.\nIn 774, the town surrendered to invading Franks led by Charlemagne, and became a center of commercial exchange.\nIn 1127, Como lost a decade-long war with the nearby town of Milan. A few decades later, with the help of Frederick Barbarossa, the Comaschi were able to avenge their defeat when Milan was destroyed in 1162. Frederick promoted the construction of several defensive towers around the city limits, of which only one, the Baradello, remains.\nSubsequently, the history of Como followed that of the Ducato di Milano, through the French invasion and the Spanish domination, until 1714, when the territory was taken by the Austrians. Napoleon descended into Lombardy in 1796 and ruled it until 1815, when the Austrian rule was resumed after the Congress of Vienna. Finally in 1859, with the arrival of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the town was freed from the Austrians and it became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Italy under the House of Savoy.\nAt the end of World War II, after passing through Como on his escape towards Switzerland, Benito Mussolini was taken prisoner and then shot by partisans in Giulino di Mezzegra, a small town on the north shores of Lake Como.\nIn 2010, a motion by members of the nationalist Swiss People's Party (SVP) has been submitted to the Swiss parliament requesting the admission of adjacent territories to the Swiss Confederation; Como (and its province) is one of these.\nThe Rockefeller fountain that today stands in the Bronx Zoo in New York City was once in the main square (Piazza Cavour) by the lakeside. It was bought by William Rockefeller in 1902 for 3,500 lire (the estimated equivalent then of $637).\nSituated at the southern tip of the south-west arm of Lake Como, is located north of Milan; the city proper borders Switzerland and the communes of Blevio, Brunate, Capiago Intimiano, Casnate con Bernate, Cavallasca, Cernobbio, Grandate, Lipomo, Maslianico, Montano Lucino, San Fermo della Battaglia, Senna Comasco, Tavernerio, Torno and the Swiss towns of Chiasso and Vacallo. Nearby major cities are Varese, Lecco and Lugano.\nComo is divided into the following (roughly equivalent to the anglocentric ward):\n1. Albate \u2013 Muggio' \u2013 Acquanera\n2. Lora\n3. Prestino \u2013 Camerlata \u2013 Breccia \u2013 Rebbio\n4. Camnago Volta\n5. City Center \u2013 West Como\n6. Borghi\n7. North Como \u2013 East Como\n8. Monte Olimpino \u2013 Ponte Chiasso \u2013 Sagnino \u2013 Tavernola\n9. Garzola \u2013 Civiglio\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Como has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa); winters are not long, but foggy, damp and chilly with occasional periods of frost from the siberian anticyclone; spring and autumn are well marked and pleasant, while summer can be quite oppressive, hot and humid. Wind is quite rare; only sudden bursts of foehn or thunderstorms manage to sweep the air clean.\nPollution levels rise significantly in winter when cold air clings to the soil. Rain is more frequent during spring; summer is subject to thunderstorms and, occasionally, violent hailstorms.\nThe economy of Como, until the end of the 1980s, was traditionally based on industry; in particular, the city was world-famous for its silk manufacturers, but in recent years cheap competition from China has significantly reduced profit margins and many small and mid-sized firms have gone out of business. As a consequence manufacturing is no longer the economic driver and the city has been absorbed into Milan's metropolitan area where it mainly provides workers to the service industry sector. A significant number of residents are employed in the nearby industrial areas of the Swiss towns of Lugano and Mendrisio, primarily in the industrial sector, health care services and in the hospitality industry; the commute is beneficial as wages in Switzerland are notably higher. For these reasons, tourism has become increasingly important for the local economy since the 1990s. The city and the lake have been chosen as the filming location for various recent popular feature films, and this, together with the increasing presence of celebrities who have bought lakeside properties, has heightened the city's international profile and given a further boost to international tourism.\nThe city of Como has seen its population count increase until it peaked at almost 100,000 inhabitants in the 1970s, when manufacturing, especially the silk industry, was in its boom years. As production began to decline, the population decreased by almost 20,000 people until the start of the 21st century, when the city saw its population grow again by more than six thousand, mainly because of immigration from Asia, Eastern Europe and North Africa. As at 31 December 2010, there were 11,156 resident aliens living in the city, that is, 13% of the total; the population distribution by origin was as follows:\nThe top 40 nationalities were:\nIn Como there are the following museums and exhibition centers:\n- Museo Archeologico \"P.

It is obtained by mixing and cooking corn flour and buckwheat. It is usually served with meat, game, cheese and sometimes fish; in fact, Polenta e Misultin (Alosa agone) is served in the restaurants in the Lake Como area.\nA traditional dish is the Risotto con Filetti di Pesce Persico or simply Risotto al Pesce Persico (European Perch filet Risotto), a fish grown in Lake Como, prepared with white wine, onion, butter and wheat.\nThe Servizio Ferroviario Regionale (Regional Railway Service) connects Como by train to other major cities in Lombardy. Services are provided by Trenord through two main stations: Como San Giovanni and Como Lago. There are five more urban stations (Albate-Camerlata, Albate-Trecallo, Como Borghi, Como Camerlata and Grandate-Breccia).\nComo San Giovanni is also a stop on the main North-South line between Milan Centrale and Z\u00fcrich and Basel. Intercity and Eurostar trains stop at this station, which makes Como very accessible from the European express train network.\nThe Como to Brunate funicular connects the center of Como with Brunate, a small village (1,800 inhabitants) on a mountain at above sea level.\nThe local public transport network comprises 11 urban (within city limits) lines and 'extra-urban' (crossing city limits) (C) lines connecting Como with most of its province centers. They are provided by ASF Autolinee.\nFerrovie Nord Milano also provides other bus lines connecting Como to Varese in substitution of the original railway line that was dismissed in the 1960s.\nA taxi service is provided by the Municipality of Como.\nThe boats and hydrofoils (aliscafi) of Navigazione Lago di Como connect the town with most of the villages sitting on the shores of the lake.\nNearby airports providing scheduled flights are Milano Malpensa, Milano Linate, Lugano Agno (in Switzerland) and Orio al Serio Airport near Bergamo. Milano Malpensa can be reached in about half an hour by car; about two hours by train to Stazione Centrale (Milano Central) and then direct shuttle coach or about an hour and a half by train (interchange in Saronno); Milano Linate can be reached by car in about an hour, or by train to Stazione Centrale and then local tram.\nBergamo's Orio al Serio Airport can be reached in about an hour and a quarter by car; in two hours by train to Milano Central and then half-hourly shuttle coach. Lugano Agno can be reached by car in less than an hour or by train in an hour and a half (changing once and walking) but it only offers direct flights to Switzerland and Italy and generally higher-priced business class or private charter.\nTrains from Como to Z\u00fcrich Airport take three to five hours.\nComo also has an \"international\" water aerodrome (\"Idroscalo\", ICAO code LILY) and seaplane base, which hosts its own aeroplane club with a fleet of sea planes, used for flight training and local tour flights.

There are also numerous recreational activities available for tourists such as pedal-boating, fishing, walking and seaplane rentals. Como also hosts a prestigious clay-court tennis tournament every year, the Citt\u00e0 di Como Challenger, which attracts many of the world's top players who are not involved in the concurrent US Open (tennis). Many players have testified that they much prefer playing in the relaxed and friendly Como environs than the hustle and bustle of Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park. Previous champions include Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta, Viktor Troicki and the 2016 champion Kenny de Schepper who once again will be eschewing the US Open to defend his crown.\nPeople born or raised in Como include:\n- Pliny the Elder (Gaius Plinius Secundus; 23\u201379 CE), author, natural philosopher and naval and military commander known for the Naturalis Historia.\n- Caecilius c. 59 CE.

Portions of West University were previously within the Harris County Poor farm, which extended from an area between Bellaire Boulevard and Bissonnet Street, eastward to an area near the \"poor farm ditch.\"\nIn the 1920s, Lillian \"Lilly\" Nicholson, a Rice University English major, lived with a friend whose father was a city planner. The city planner asked Nicholson and her friend to name the streets of West University Place. Nicholson took names from her English literature book and gave them to the streets in West University Place. As a result, many West University streets are named after authors, such as Geoffrey Chaucer, John Dryden, and William Shakespeare. Cydney Mackey, a family friend of Nicholson, said in a Houston Chronicle article, \"Aunt Lilly had always said she wanted to be an architect, unknown for women in that era, and this was her way of making a small but lasting mark on our city's landscape.\" One street, Weslayan Road, is a misspelling of \"Wesleyan.\"\nThe city incorporated in 1924 because Houston was reluctant to extend power lines that far from the city center. West University Place, unlike Houston Heights, did not consolidate into the City of Houston. Because of the 1923 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate West University Place's territory into its city limits, while Houston annexed surrounding areas that were unincorporated. In 1939, the municipality refused to consolidate, later adopting a formal city charter the following year. The city had around 15,000 residents in the 1960s and the 1970s. The city had 12,714 people in 1990.\nPrior to 1992 West University Place liberalized its development rules. This allowed developers to build new houses within the city. Don Stowers of the Houston Post said that West University Place changed from an \"aging middle class neighborhood\" consisting of mid-20th century bungalows and cottages to an increasingly wealthy community of \"dare we say, young urban professionals in their austere red-brick Georgians.\" As new houses appeared, property values increased and the city began to get more tax money. Eventually, West University Place ran out of available lots, and its construction peaked. Area home buyers began to consider nearby Bellaire because it had more inexpensive and larger lots, and amenities described by Stowers as \"comparable\" to West University Place's amenities. In 2011 the group On Numbers ranked West U as the community in the Southern United States with the highest quality of life. it was later ranked number one in a comparison of regional winners. \nWest University Place is located at (29.715929, \u221295.432992).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.\nThe City of Houston surrounds much of West University Place. The boundaries are roughly Bellaire Boulevard/Holcombe Boulevard, Kirby Drive, Bissonnet Road, and Community Drive.\nThe city's boundaries are Kirby Drive to the east, Union Pacific St. Louis Southwestern Railway railroad track to the west, Bellaire Boulevard/West Holcombe Boulevard to the south, and Bissonnet and Law Streets to the north. Viewed on a map, the city shape resembles a little house, with a \"chimney\" to the west side, and since it surrounds the city of Southside Place, a \"door\" is formed on the map surrounding Southside Place. (See map) \nThe Poor Farm Ditch is a ditch that drains into the Brays Bayou that formerly belonged to the Harris County poor farm. In 1928 the ditch was dredged after significant flooding had occurred in the area. On occasions the ditch still flooded. The commissioners of the City of West University adjourned their meeting so they could dam streets in December 1935. The Harris County Flood Control District, in 1954, widened and deepened the ditch and added a concrete bottom and siding. During that year the district installed a chain link fence. To make the ditch more attractive, the Sunset Terrace Garden Club planted oleanders around the ditch; the oleanders obscure the view of the ditch from Edloe Street to the east. The West University Garden Club maintained the flowers. A 2001 Edloe Greenbelt proposal called for the removal of the flowers.\nThe typical lot size in West University Place is . The original housing stock of West University Place consisted of mid-20th century bungalows and cottages. Prior to 1992 the City of West University place liberalized its development rules, allowing for new houses to be built in the city. As lot sizes were typically about by , the houses constructed were Georgian houses described by Don Stowers of the Houston Post as \"lot hugging.\" Because nearby Bellaire had larger, more inexpensive lots, many area home seekers began to consider Bellaire. In a 15-year period ending in 2002 around half of the existing houses in West University Place were torn down and replaced with newer houses. In 2001 Katherine Feser of the Houston Chronicle said that land lots selling for over $1 million ($ in today's money) were common in West University Place.\nOne subdivision in West University is called \"Rice Court\", which is located north of University Boulevard and east of Buffalo Speedway. Rice Court once was distinguished by blue tile markers; the markers began to disappear around the 1990s. \"Pemberton\" is an area south of University Drive and east of Wakeforest Street. People living in the area were fond of restoration of older houses, and it includes some of West U's more expensive homes.

The population was 4,124 at the 2010 census.\n", "text": "In 1885, a group of 25 taxpayers of Granville County including Civil War Confederate veteran Robert Fleming appeared before the Board of Commissioners for the County of Granville with a petition from the Dutchville Township. The petition made a proposition to subscribe ten thousand dollars to the capital stock of the Oxford and Clarksville Railroad Company. Under the provisions of the act of the General Assembly of North Carolina which was entitled \"An Act to Incorporate\", the Oxford and Clarksville Railroad Company was notified on 28 February 1885. The proposal was thereby approved under the provisions of the General Assembly of North Carolina. As a result, it was ordered that the election of subscribing the said sum of ten thousand dollars to the capital stock of the said railroad company be submitted to the qualified voters of the Dutchville Township and that an election be held in the said township at the proper voting place therein on 8 October 1887.\nOver the next few years, Creedmoor served as a railroad depot between the Clarksville and Oxford Railroad and the Raleigh and Gaston Railroad. In 1886, Thomas B. Lyon applied to the Postal Department for a post office to be located in Creedmoor. Lyon's request was granted on 10 April 1886. John Harmon was appointed as the first postmaster. In September of that same year, Samuel C. Lyon, son of Thomas B. Lyon, was appointed postmaster.\nCreedmoor was incorporated in 1905, having previously been known as \"Creedmore\". The first mayor was Joseph L. Peed (1859\u20131936). In 1888 Lyon sold part of his land to the Durham and Northern Railroad for track to run through the town. Linking Creedmoor to Henderson and Durham was a major cause of growth of this town. The old Seaboard train depot building still stands at its location on Elm Street, making it over 120 years old.\nAlso previously located on Elm Street was the original First Baptist Church of Creedmoor, built in 1895. The present church building from 1950 stands on Main Street. Lyon's body is entombed on the grounds of the original cemetery for the church, whereas Robert Fleming's body is entombed in a small family plot on Fleming Street, a road named for the founder, adjacent to Elm Street. In 1917, electricity came to Creedmoor when G. H. Dove and F. J. McDuffy flipped a switch in their plant on Railroad Street.\nAlthough the town is rich with history (home to four buildings on the National Register of Historic Places), it does not hold the title of a Historic District unlike nearby Oxford and Wake Forest.\nTobacco was extremely important in the early history of the town. Four tobacco warehouses were built in the town in the early 1900s. Tobacco was a cash crop in Creedmoor, and was shipped by railroad to nearby Oxford's Tobacco Research Facility and Durham's thriving smoking tobacco industry, with firms including W. T. Blackwell and Company, American Tobacco Company, and Liggett & Myers. At one time Creedmoor was a larger tobacco market than Durham. Area farmers did not limit themselves to tobacco only, but also grew cotton, a profitable crop.\nIn the wake of the tobacco era, mules came to Creedmoor. About forty train car loads of mules were pulled into the town each year. Mules were the ideal farm animals because their hooves were smaller than those of a horse. Their smaller feet helped them pass through rows of tobacco without stepping on the crop. In 1906, Jim Netherly and a Mr. Cooper founded the Creedmoor Supply Company, which sold feed, mules, horses, buggies, and even some groceries and seeds to meet the demands of local farmers. G.M. Chappell opened a barn that auctioned mules, horses, and cows from 1938 to 1962. At one point in time, Creedmoor was considered to be the largest mule trading center in the world and was widely referred to as \"Mule Town\". By 1940, over $500,000 were traded and spent on mules each year. It was not until the mid-1950s that the town removed the slogan \"One of the Largest Retail Livestock Markets in North Carolina\" from the official letterhead. By then, the mule trade was no longer a major part of the local economy.\nCreedmoor is home to four buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places: \n- Cannady-Brogden Farm south of Creedmoor in Wake County\n- James Mangum House\n- First National Bank Building\n- Obediah Winston Farm\nCreedmoor High School opened in 1909 at the intersection of Main Street and Highway 56. Joel Anderson Pitts (1877\u20131958), a graduate of Duke University \u2013 then called Trinity College \u2013 was the first principal. This school served grades one through twelve until 1963, when white students went to South Granville High School. On January 9, 1970, Creedmoor School, at that time serving grades one through eight, burned down. Behind the former Creedmoor High School gym lies B.C. Roberts Ballfield, named after Battle Caviness Roberts who coached for the South Granville Athletic Association well into his years before his death in 1982.\nCreedmoor is also the home of South Granville High School, G.C. Hawley Middle, and Creedmoor Elementary. The Hawley School, dedicated in 1937 for educationalist Rev. Grover Cleveland Hawley, originally educated the local black students. The doors to Hawley School first opened for all local black students in September 1952 after many years of tireless and dedicated work spearheaded by Reverend Hawley. The new facility housed grades seven through twelve. In 1975, Hawley became a middle school serving grades five through eight from the Butner, Stem, and Creedmoor areas and eighth graders from Wilton. In September 1986, seventh graders from Wilton Elementary were moved to Hawley, and in 1987 sixth graders from Wilton also began to attend Hawley. At the present time, Hawley Middle School teaches grades six through eight from the Creedmoor and Wilton area. Students from Butner and Stem now attend Butner-Stem Middle School.\nLike most towns, Creedmoor has a variety of media.

Amber from the area has been found at archaeological sites dating from the Nara period at the site of Heij\u014d-ky\u014d and Fujiwara-ky\u014d. The area came under the control of the central government only after 1070 AD in the mid-Heian period. From the Kamakura period, the area came under the control of the Nanbu clan, and during the Edo period, was part of Hachinohe Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. The area was noted for its production of ironsand, essential in the production of Japanese swords. These deposits were exploited commercially from the Meiji period, but were exhausted by the 1960s.\nIn the early Meiji period, the town of Kuji was created within Kita-Kunohe District on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. The area was devastated by a tsunami in 1896, which killed 789 inhabitants. Kita-Kunohe District and Minami-Kunohe Districts merged to form Kunohe District on April 1, 1897. In January 1926, much of the town was destroyed by a fire which consumed 224 houses. An even larger fire in April 1945 destroyed 950 houses. The modern city was founded on November 3, 1954, with the merger of the towns of Kuji and Osanai with the villages of Samuraihama, Yamane, Natsui, Ube, and Okawame. In April 1983, a fire destroyed 61 homes in the city.\nOn March 6, 2006, the village of Yamagata (from Kunohe District), was merged into Kuji.\nKuji suffered extensive damage from the earthquake and tsunami, with the tsunami reaching in some locations, and the tsunami damage extending inland.

Records of Franklin, Indiana and Mayor Gyobun Yamauchi, Mayor of Kuji, Japan. A Franklin College graduate and childhood resident of Franklin, Miss Thomasine Allen had traveled to Japan to pursue Christian missionary work. After teaching in various locations in Japan for several years from 1915, she found her way to Kuji, Japan in 1938 and spent the rest of her life there (with the exception of repatriation during WWII), establishing Christian facilities including a kindergarten, hospital, church and college. Upon establishment of the sister city relationship, Thomasine Allen was voted by the City Council of Kuji to be an honorary citizen of the city.\nPartnership between Kuji and Klaip\u0117da began in 1989, one year before the independence of Lithuania, hence becoming the first Lithuanian sister city in Japan. In January 1991, then-Mayor of Kuji, Yoshiaki Kuji, condemned the military actions of Soviet Union by sending a protest note to the General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev. The 1995 World Municipalities Congress in Hague recognised Klaipeda\u2019s and Kuji\u2019s cities cooperation as an example to follow. Congress expressed hope that this cooperation will inspire other Lithuania\u2019s and Japan\u2019s cities to expand their partnership.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 262, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 262, "length": 381, "sectionHeading": "Geography | Climate", "sectionLabel": "city.climate"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 643, "length": 95, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 738, "length": 1794, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2532, "length": 123, "sectionHeading": "Government", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2655, "length": 210, "sectionHeading": "Economy", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2865, "length": 258, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3123, "length": 205, "sectionHeading": "Local attractions | Kuji amber", "sectionLabel": "city.tourism"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3328, "length": 231, "sectionHeading": "Local attractions | Ama divers", "sectionLabel": "city.tourism"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3559, "length": 138, "sectionHeading": "Local attractions | Kokuji-yaki", "sectionLabel": "city.tourism"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3697, "length": 166, "sectionHeading": "Local attractions | Kosode Coast", "sectionLabel": "city.tourism"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3863, "length": 721, "sectionHeading": "International relations | Ties with Franklin", "sectionLabel": "city.international_affairs"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4584, "length": 589, "sectionHeading": "International relations | Ties with Klaip\u0117da", "sectionLabel": "city.international_affairs"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamblee,_Georgia", "type": "city", "title": "Chamblee, Georgia", "abstract": "Chamblee (Sham-blee) is a city in northern DeKalb County, Georgia, United States, northeast of Atlanta.

During the late nineteenth century, an intersection of two railroads was constructed in Chamblee; one carried passengers from Atlanta to Charlotte, North Carolina, while the other ferried workers and goods back and forth from a factory in Roswell to Atlanta. A settlement known as Roswell Junction emerged at the intersection, and the United States Postal Service decided to establish a post office there. However, feeling the name of the settlement was too similar to nearby Roswell, they randomly selected Chamblee from a list of petitioners for the new post office name. Chamblee was incorporated in 1907.\nDuring World War I and World War II, Chamblee served as the site of U.S. military operations. During World War I, the U.S. operated Camp Gordon, home to 40,000 servicemen. This influx of new people created a building boom in the town. Camp Gordon was closed after the war and then re-opened as Navy Flight Training Center at the advent of World War II.\nImmediately after World War II, Chamblee experienced growth in blue-collar industry and residents due to its proximity to the newly opened General Motors plant in neighboring Doraville. Manufacturing plants also located along the newly constructed Peachtree Industrial Boulevard. By the 1980s, much of the city's industrial base had downsized or eroded; in its place sprung multi-ethnic business that catered to the immigrants and refugees moving to Chamblee and Doraville en masse due to the cities' affordable housing. By the time of the 1996 Summer Olympics, Chamblee had emerged as a multi-cultural city inhabited by a large immigrant community.\nDuring the first decade of the 2000s, the city grew as it refined its image, constructing a new city hall in 2002.

When the rural statistics are compiled into the city stats, the total population of Eustis topped 50,000 in 2000.\nNumerous educational institutions are zoned for Eustis, including: Eustis Heights Elementary, Eustis Elementary, Eustis Middle School, Eustis High School, and Alee Academy.\nThe people of Eustis, on the east shore of Lake Eustis, took their time deciding on a name. First it was Highlands, then Pendryville, and finally Lake Eustis, itself named about 1825 for General Abraham Eustis. General Eustis, prominent in the Seminole Wars, had skirmished with the Indians on the south shore, near present-day Tavares, Florida. In 1876, A.S. Pendry homesteaded and set out a citrus grove. In 1877 he opened the Ocklawaha Hotel. The post office in the lobby carried the sign Pendryville\". \nBefore railroads came in the 1880s, Eustis was a busy port for steamers plying Lakes Harris, Eustis, Dora, and Griffin. In 1883 the \"Lake\" was dropped and the town became just Eustis. Although the U.S. opened up the area for homesteading in the 1850s, settlement was delayed by the Civil War. Surveying was finally completed in 1875 and settlement began in earnest. Among the earliest settlers was Guilford David \"G.D.\" Clifford, who established a store and began the first mail service for the new settlement. It was in the Clifford General Store second floor meeting hall that the town's first churches were formed. Episcopal, Methodist, and Presbyterian groups all organized and held services there before they had their own buildings.\nThe first homes were those of D.W. Herrick, A.D. Herrick, and Henry Key. In 1881 Clifford and Smith built the first general store in the building later occupied by A.D. and C.D. Miller. A big year was 1878 when the town's first telegraph line connected Eustis, Leesburg, and Sanford. The railroad arrived in 1880, the first train coming from Astor to Fort Mason, where passengers and freight made lake steamer connections to Leesburg, Helena, Yalaha, Bloomfield, Lane Park and Tavares. Bertie Clifford was the first baby born before Eustis was incorporated in 1883, and Edith Hutchins the first baby of the newly incorporated town. D.W. Herrick was the first mayor. G.D. Clifford's dream home in Eustis was designed in 1894 but the Big Freeze of 1894-95 postponed its completion until 1911. Says Eustis historian Louise Carter, \"Even though the freeze brought the town's economy to a standstill, Mr. Clifford kept his lakefront general store open and extended credit until people could recover.\" \nAccording to an 1887 business directory, the Clifford Store on Lake Eustis sold \"groceries, hardware, building material, fertilizers, stoves, crockery, glassware, hay and grain. The opera house, on the second floor, was a cultural center of Eustis and a wide swath of Central Florida. The eighteen-room house at the corner of Bay Street and Bates Avenue today houses the Eustis Historical Museum and Preservation Society, and takes visitors back to the gracious Lake County lifestyle of one hundred-odd years ago.\nDr. J. H. Potter, the founding pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, encouraged the development of Eustis Seminary in 1886, under the direction of Professor Byron F. Marsh (for whom Marsh Memorial Park is named). The seminary served students from first through twelfth grades. Its buildings were located near the present site of Eustis High School on Washington Avenue. Struggling financially, the school closed around 1895. By the early 1900s, Eustis was already a winter vacation spot for many. The Ocklawaha Hotel catered to the wealthy. Eustis continues to be a popular winter destination.\nThere are several locations in Eustis which have been included in the National Register of Historic Places.\nThey are:\n- Clifford House\n- Eustis Commercial Historic District\n- Ferran Park and the Alice McClelland Memorial Bandshell\n- Gould Hyde Norton House\n- Moses J.

Economic hardships brought an end to the Co-op in 1895, though the Co-op had first started selling businesses off in 1876.\nWorld War II brought a major economic boost to the city. The federal government created Bushnell General Hospital on Brigham City's south side to treat soldiers wounded in the war. Locals sold supplies and food to the hospital while hospital staff patronized local businesses. After the war, the hospital's buildings were used as Intermountain Indian School. Many young Native Americans attended the boarding school until it closed in 1984, although the Intermountain \"I\" on the mountain is still visible in tandem with Box Elder High School's \"B\". The facility has left its mark in a number of other ways, with most of the buildings still standing. Some have been converted into businesses and condos, while others remain empty. Utah State University purchased the site and demolished all remaining buildings in 2013. The Utah State University Brigham City regional campus will be expanded to permanent buildings on this site and will mainly serve students from Box Elder, Weber and Davis counties. Construction will begin in the fall of 2014.\nDespite layoffs over the past decade, much of Brigham City's economy relies on Thiokol, the creator of many missiles, as well as the solid rocket booster for the Space Shuttle. Additionally, the local Autoliv (formerly a part of Thiokol) airbag plants also net Brigham City many jobs. Nucor Corporation has two facilities in Brigham City, in addition to its steel mill in nearby Plymouth. The addition of a Walmart distribution center in nearby Corinne has also brought new jobs.\nBuilt in 1870 as part of the Brigham City Manufacturing and Mercantile Association, the mill produced high-quality blankets and sweaters from locally produced wool fleeces. Destroyed by fire.\nDr. A.D. Cooley opened this hospital in 1935, operating as the only acute care facility in Brigham City until 1976 when the Brigham City Community Hospital opened.\nOriginally built to house transient railroad workers, rooms in Hotel Brigham were meant to be inexpensive. Very few rooms had bathrooms. An original owner was James Knudson, a former mayor of Brigham City. His grandson, Cameron Kay Harmon, became a part owner and managed the hotel after World War II and into the 1950s.\nInstalled September 6, 1928, this sign was financed by citizen donations totaling $2,400. The sign spans the width of Main Street, welcoming visitors to the charming business district. Made of opalite glass, the lettering welcomes all to Brigham City, \"Gateway to the World's Greatest Wild Bird Refuge.\"\nEstablished in 1853 with the burial of a pioneer infant, the Brigham City cemetery is a beautiful, old-fashioned cemetery with above ground grave markers. A final resting place for pioneers, peach orchard farmers, cholera epidemic victims, workers and a host of others, the cemetery is peaceful and shaded with a wide variety of grand old trees.\nBrigham City lies in southeastern Box Elder County on the western slopes of the Wellsville Mountains, a branch of the Wasatch Range, at the western end of Box Elder Canyon. Brigham City is generally considered to be the northern end of the Wasatch Front. To the west is a large, flat region of desert scrub, eventually giving way to marshlands on the edge of the Great Salt Lake. Interstates 15 and 84 pass to the west of the city together. U.S. 89 approaches from the south and U.S. 91 comes from I-15/84 to the west. They intersect in the city, climbing through Box Elder Canyon together. Two routes of the Utah Transit Authority's bus system also provide access to Brigham City from Ogden, and it also has a Greyhound bus stop. It is planned to be the northern terminus of the FrontRunner commuter rail line by 2020.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.40%, is water. It lies at an elevation of .\nThe climate of Brigham City is generally the same as that of the rest of the Wasatch Front. Snow is heavy in winter with an annual average of , although it is too far north to receive lake-effect snow. Precipitation is light, averaging annually. Summers are hot, but humidity remains low and overnight temperatures are cool, and winters are cold (but rarely frigid). April is the wettest month, while July is the driest.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 17,411 people, 5,526 households, and 4,409 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,216.4 people per square mile (469.8/km\u00b2). There were 5,838 housing units at an average density of 407.9 per square mile (157.5/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the city was 91.26% White, 0.24% African American, 1.63% Native American, 0.77% Asian, 0.10% Pacific Islander, 4.07% from other races, and 1.93% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 7.67% of the population.\nThere were 5,526 households out of which 44.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.4% were married couples living together, 9.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.2% were non-families. 18.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.09 and the average family size was 3.53.\nIn the city, the age distribution of the population shows 34.2% under the age of 18, 11.1% from 18 to 24, 25.2% from 25 to 44, 17.4% from 45 to 64, and 12.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 29 years. For every 100 females there were 100.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.9 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $42,335, and the median income for a family was $46,891. Males had a median income of $39,271 versus $22,061 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,503. About 7.3% of families and 8.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 9.7% of those under age 18 and 7.1% of those age 65 or over.\nBrigham City has museums covering the area's art and history (the Brigham City Museum-Gallery) and natural history (the Box Elder Museum). There is an LDS tabernacle in downtown Brigham City, as well as a temple. The city is located in a prime historical and environmental region. Nearby attractions include Golden Spike National Historic Site, which lies northwest of the city near Promontory Summit. State Route 13 heads northwest from Brigham City and turns north at Corinne. However, State Route 83 continues west from there and eventually reaches Lampo Junction, where the turnoff to the historic site is located. The work of art known as the Spiral Jetty lies west-southwest of this site. The Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge lies directly west of Brigham City on the northeast side of the Great Salt Lake at the mouth of the Bear River.\nBrigham City is part of the Box Elder School District. Schools include:\n- Box Elder High School\n- Dale Young Community High School\n- Box Elder Middle School\n- Adele C. Young Intermediate School\n- Discovery Elementary\n- Foothill Elementary\n- Lake View Elementary\n- Mountain View Elementary\nUtah State University-Brigham City and Bridgerland Applied Technology College are located in Brigham City.\nBrigham City was the namesake of American movie director, producer, writer, and actor Richard Dutcher's 2001 film Brigham City about murder in a fictitious small Mormon town, although it is not actually about the real Brigham City. Due to geography and population, the movie was actually filmed some 120 miles to the south in Mapleton, Utah.\nMovies that have scenes filmed in Brigham City include The Work and the Story, Species, and Clay Pigeons.\nThe company Smith's Food and Drug was started in Brigham City.\nThe company Flying J was started in Brigham City and operated there as one of the largest privately held companies until a few years ago when it relocated its headquarters to Ogden, Utah.\nThe LDS Church President Brigham Young, for whom Brigham City is named, gave his final public address in the city. He gave this address in a public square that is now home to the Brigham City Museum-Gallery.\nThe LDS prophet Lorenzo Snow is buried in the Brigham City Cemetery.\nIn 2012 an LDS temple was built across from the historic Box Elder Stake Tabernacle.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 2669, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2669, "length": 192, "sectionHeading": "History | Historic sites | Baron Woolen Mills", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2861, "length": 164, "sectionHeading": "History | Historic sites | Cooley Memorial Hospital", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3025, "length": 321, "sectionHeading": "History | Historic sites | Hotel Brigham", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3346, "length": 304, "sectionHeading": "History | Historic sites | Brigham City Archway Sign", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3650, "length": 346, "sectionHeading": "History | Historic sites | Brigham City Cemetery", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3996, "length": 1390, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5386, "length": 1644, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7030, "length": 844, "sectionHeading": "Arts and culture", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7874, "length": 289, "sectionHeading": "Education | Public schools", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 8163, "length": 107, "sectionHeading": "Education | Post secondary", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 8270, "length": 1061, "sectionHeading": "In popular culture", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansonia,_Connecticut", "type": "city", "title": "Ansonia, Connecticut", "abstract": "Ansonia is a city in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States, on the Naugatuck River, immediately north of Derby, and about northwest of New Haven. The population was 19,249 at the 2010 census. The ZIP code for Ansonia is 06401. The city is served by the Metro-North Railroad. Ansonia Station is a stop on the railroad passenger commuter service's Waterbury line, connecting to New York's Grand Central Terminal. Ansonia also is served by the Connecticut Transit bus carrier. Connecticut Route 8 serves Ansonia (Northbound, Exit 18; Southbound, Exit 19).\nAnsonia, also referred to as \"The Copper City\", is recognized for its history of heavy machine manufacturing industry in the lower Naugatuck Valley. Production included copper, brass, rubber and plastics processing, molding and tubing, iron castings, sheet metal, electric, automatic screw machine, textiles, and foundry products. The well-known Ansonia Clock Company was founded here in 1851.\nAnsonia is the birthplace of American Revolutionary War Colonel and Diplomat David Humphreys. The city's devotion to its high school football team, the Ansonia Chargers, is legendary. Originally known as \"The Lavender\", the Chargers' annual game against arch-rival Naugatuck, on Thanksgiving morning, is one of the more significant events of the year for the two cities.\n", "text": "The area along the Naugatuck River, comprising the present Elm Street section of Ansonia and Derby Avenue section of Derby, was first settled by English colonists in 1652; it was originally a part of the township of Derby. Early settlers developed subsistence farming, and used the river for sawmills and gristmills.\nIn 1844, Anson Green Phelps (1781\u20131853), a merchant and philanthropist, wanted to expand the old borough of Birmingham (the present downtown of the city of Derby) to the north along the west side of the Naugatuck River to enable industrial development. Unable to purchase the land from its owner, in 1844 Phelps acquired land along the east side of the river; today this is Ansonia's downtown section. A canal was dug for river power to drive the factories and businesses in the new industrial village, which Phelps named \"Ansonia\". He wanted to name the industrial village as \"Phelpsville\", but learned there was another village in the region by that name. As suggested by a friend, Phelps Latinized his first name to create the name \"Ansonia\".\nAs industry developed, soon Ansonia became the most populous area of Derby, boasting many factories. The state chartered Ansonia as a borough of Derby in 1864 and amended it in 1871, granting full municipal privileges. In 1888, a petition was circulated in the borough of Ansonia for the purpose of becoming a separate township from Derby. In 1889 the State General Assembly granted the separation, constituting the Borough, Hilltop, West Ansonia, and Elm Street areas as a separate town known as Ansonia. This was the 168th township in the state of Connecticut. In 1893, Ansonia was incorporated as a city, consolidating with the coterminous Town and the old borough.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the city had manufacturers of heavy machinery, electric supplies, brass and copper products, and silk goods. Ansonia, Derby, Shelton, Seymour, and Beacon Falls formed one of the most important industrial communities in the state.\nIn 1866, while residing in Ansonia, inventor Pierre Lallement, a native of Pont-a-Mousson, France, submitted a patent application for the first pedaled (rotary crank mechanism) bicycle.\nAnsonia suffered grievous damage in the Flood of 1955 on August 19, when the Naugatuck River flooded due to heavy rain from Hurricane Diane. Submerging the land along the river, the flood destroyed many houses and businesses. The high river waters swept away Maple Street Bridge, one of two bridges linking the east and west sides of Ansonia. After the inundation, the authorities erected a flood wall along the east bank of the river to protect the city's factories and Main Street. On the west bank, federal public housing was built to replace blocks of destroyed homes and businesses on Broad Street, now known as Olson Drive.\nIn the decades following the flood and suburbanization, Ansonia's Main Street fell into decline as retail shoppers decamped to the Ansonia Mall at its far end. (This has been replaced by a Big Y supermarket.) Later other malls attracted shoppers to nearby Milford, Trumbull, and Waterbury. Since the late 20th century, Main Street has been enlivened by he opening of several antique stores, a wine bar, a coffee shop, a Polish delicatessen, and other retail businesses.\nMain Street now has a 'TARGET' Store where the old American Brass Co. Wire Mill, later Farrel's Corp, building was located\nFor years, Ansonia had a daily newspaper, the \"Evening Sentinel\", that enjoyed a wide readership throughout the Naugatuck Valley. However, the parent company of the Connecticut Post bought the Sentinel in the 1980s and quickly closed it, despite their promises not to do so. Allegedly, the \"Post\" wanted to consolidate their position as the region's main newspaper. To provide an alternative, a non-profit, online-only news site, named The Valley Independent Sentinel in honor of the historic paper, has been organized and launched June 22, 2009.\nIn the early morning hours of November 6, 1960, Senator John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign motorcade stopped on its way to Waterbury for the candidate to make an appearance and brief address in front of City Hall. He drew thousands to downtown, many with transistor radios tuned to live reports on WADS of Senator Kennedy's progress towards Ansonia. President Kennedy returned to Ansonia on October 17, 1962, while on his way to Waterbury, but did not stop here. \nPresident George H. W. Bush paid a visit to Ansonia by helicopter during the 1992 presidential election campaign. He was running far behind schedule due to severe weather damage to a large area of New Jersey. He arrived late and delivered a truncated speech, causing many residents in this heavily Democratic area to feel he had slighted their city. \nIn 2000, the Lower Naugatuck Valley, which includes Ansonia, was named an \"All America City\" by the National Civic League.\nIn May 2001, a wind-driven fire destroyed the Latex Foam Company building, a very large rubber plant along the Naugatuck River in downtown Ansonia. The fire gutted the building, which was the workplace of 250 people. Firefighters from multiple counties fought the fire tirelessly for five days. Lingering clouds of foul-smelling smoke spread over the city and nearby communities, and chemical runoff produced by the fire unbalanced the ecosystem of the nearby river. The aforementioned Target store was constructed on the empty lot, opening in July 2007. Following the fire, the Latex Foam Company purchased a vacant plant off Route 110 in nearby Shelton and resumed production.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.72%, is water. The city is bisected by the Naugatuck River and spreads out from the river's banks up the hills \u2013 some quite steep \u2013 of the river valley. On the west side of the river, the city abuts Derby and Seymour along Silver Hill. On the east side, the city's Hilltop neighborhood meets Woodbridge.\nThe land along the river is mostly given over to factory sites (both operational and defunct), with an area of wooded land on the west bank close to the city's northern boundary that belongs to the American Brass Company. In the early 1990s, this site was proposed by Texas company American Ref-Fuel for a solid waste-to-electric energy cogeneration plant. The proposal was controversial, and protests by residents resulted in its defeat.\nResidential housing occupies most of the land in Ansonia, chiefly one- or two-family houses on plots of a 1/4 acre up to an acre. Larger houses on larger plots are found in the Hilltop neighborhood. The Ansonia Nature Center on Hilltop preserves some open fields and woodlands and is a favorite for school trips.\nAn airport once operated on Hilltop on a grass field, at the eastern edge of the city. During the Cold War, the United States military deployed Nike missiles in silos at the airport. Since the military released the airport grounds for other uses, developers have built residential housing there. The Nike base is now adapted as a horse farm with riding stables; few reminders of its former operations remain.\nDowntown \u2013 The original industrial village and later borough of Ansonia. Includes the area stretching between the factories at the north side of down town to the newer shopping plazas on the south side of downtown (Big Y, Target, etc.)\nLibrary District \u2013 The neighborhood surrounding the Ansonia Library. Just east of downtown on top of the cliff. Includes the residential neighborhood between State Street and Beaver Street including South Cliff Street, North Cliff Street, Mott Street and Cottage Avenue. Contains mostly single-family historic Queen Anne Victorian homes. While now predominantly middle class, this area was settled early in Ansonia's history and was once home to many of the wealthy industrial families of Ansonia.\nNorth End \u2013 The area comprising the North Main Street corridor stretching from Downtown to the Seymour town line.\nReservoir - The area comprises the area of the Beaver, North Prospect, and Prospect Street corridors. It is along the Quillinan Reservoir.\nDerby Hill \u2013 The area surrounding the Elm Street and Jewett Street area on the east side. Elm Street is also the town's historic district and was part of the original 1654 settlement of Derby. The name of this section of the town is sometimes disputed.\nHilltop \u2013 The area of the city that comprises the area of Prindle Avenue, Pulaski Highway and Ford Street corridors. This section was mainly farm land in the early days of the town. After World War II, it was developed as the largest residential area of the city.\nWest Ansonia \u2013 The residential village that comprised the west side of the Naugatuck River across from Ansonia (downtown). The original West Ansonia neighborhood consisted of High, Maple, and Jersey streets (the latter somewhat redirected and now known as 'Olson Drive'), and later its name was synonymous with the entire present west side of the city.\nWindy Hill \u2013 A section of West Ansonia centered around Murray, May, and Francis street. This area is considered to encompass the territory from the Derby town line to Grove Street.\nSilver Hill \u2013 The section of West Ansonia along the Silver Hill Road corridor. Parts of this section are shared with Derby.\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification system, Ansonia has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \"Cfa\" on climate maps.\n As of the 2010 census, the population of Ansonia was 19,249. The racial composition of the population was 77.6% white, 11.6% black or African American, 0.3% Native American, 1.9% Asian, 5.3% reporting some other race and 3.2% from two or more race. 16.7% of the population was Hispanic or Latino of any race.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 18,554 people, 7,507 households, and 4,977 families residing in the city. The population density was 3,076.3 people per square mile (1,188.0/km). There were 7,937 housing units at an average density of 1,316.0 per square mile (508.2/km). The racial makeup of the city was 85.52% White, 8.42% Black or African American, 0.34% Native American, 1.13% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 2.22% from other races, and 2.37% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 7.42% of the population.\nThere were 7,507 households out of which 31.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.1% were married couples living together, 15.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.7% were non-families. 28.5% of all households were made up of individuals and 12.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.46 and the average family size was 3.03.\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 24.2% under the age of 18, 8.2% from 18 to 24, 31.5% from 25 to 44, 20.7% from 45 to 64, and 15.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females there were 90.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.9 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $43,026, and the median income for a family was $53,718. Males had a median income of $30,747 versus $28,517 for females. The per capita income for the city was $20,504. About 6.2% of families and 7.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 12.3% of those under age 18 and 5.3% of those age 65 or over.\nMinor party affiliations include members of the Concerned Citizens Party and the Green Party.\nPulitzer Prize-winning author Theodore H. White referred to the Naugatuck Valley \"as the seedbed of Yankee ingenuity\" in his work The Making of the President, 1960. The city hosted the world headquarters of the Farrel Corporation, a leading producer of plastics and rubber processing equipment including the Banbury International Mixer. Ansonia Copper & Brass, which supplied metal rod, wire and tube products to manufacturers of finished commercial products, also was located in the city.\nThe highly successful Ansonia Clock Company had its start manufacturing Ansonia clocks in the city in 1851. The company moved to Brooklyn, New York, in 1878 but retained its home city's name.\nSince the late 20th century, much of the heavy industry has moved out, with jobs going overseas. The former factories sat vacant. In the late 1980s the city began development of the Fountain Lake Commerce Park in the northwest border. It houses Spectrum Plastics and Homa Pump Co. In 2007 work was to begin by R.D. Scinto Inc. owned by Robert Scinto to further develop the park with a office building.\nStarting in 2002, city authorities and residents began a revitalization of the downtown area. Two large regional clothing retailers, Marshalls and Bob's, opened stores there in 2006. In 2007, Target, an international department store, constructed a new store at the former Latex Foam Company site (see \"Rubber Plant Fire\" above). In 2009, the Coca-Cola Freestyle was launched in the Ansonia Duchess restaurant. It was the first Freestyle machine in the world to be launched.\nAs a result of economic growth and plentiful employment in southwestern Connecticut, driven by corporate relocations from the New York City and Fairfield County metropolitan areas to nearby towns, Ansonia's housing market improved in the early 2000s. On the preferred East Side of the city, the average home price climbed almost 20% in the period from 2001 to 2006. Authorities are closing down federal housing projects on the West Side of town, in favor of a mixture of market-rate housing. There have been many changes in policy related to public housing. Due to a concentration of poverty in this area, it suffered a large percentage of the crime.\nAnsonia is a station stop on the Waterbury Branch of the Metropolitan Transit Authority's Metro-North Railroad system. Trains on the Waterbury Branch run from Waterbury in the north to Bridgeport in the south, allowing Ansonia residents access to New York City via transfer to the main line at Bridgeport. Travel time from Ansonia to Grand Central Terminal in New York City is approximately two hours. Ansonia is also served by buses of the F route of Connecticut Transit New Haven, connecting the city to New Haven.\nAnsonia is protected by three municipal public safety agencies. It operates an Office of Emergency Management-based out of City Hall and the A.R.M.S building on West Main Street.\nThe Ansonia Rescue Medical Service provides ambulance and rescue services to the city. Also known as \"A.R.M.S.\", the service was founded in 1991, derived from the former Ansonia Civil Defense Administration. ARMS operates three ambulances, a first responder vehicle, a rescue truck, an air and lighting vehicle, a mass casualty response truck, as well as a number of support and lighting trailers. The organization is composed of volunteer and part-time paid personnel to operate the ambulances. ARMS is part of the South Central Regional Emergency Communications System (C-MED New Haven) and provides mutual aid assistance to surrounding communities when the need is requested. ARMS is led by a chief, two assistant chiefs and a Board of Commissioners; it staffs a paid day-time supervisor and volunteer captains and lieutenants. ARMS' headquarters is located on West Main Street.\nThe Ansonia Fire Department traces its history to its founding in 1871 by the then-borough of Ansonia government. On August 24, 1871 some prominent residents organized the borough's first fire company, to be named the Ansonia Fire Company No. 1. Shortly after, the fire company purchased a used four-wheel hose carriage, which bore the name \"Eagle Hose Co.\" and had the number \"6\" etched on the glass of the carriage's lanterns. The company members decided it would cause too much damage to try and remove the name and number. As a result, the membership named the company as the \"Eagle Hose Company No. 6\". In 1879, the borough purchased a hook and ladder truck for the fire company, at which time the \"Eagle Hose\" amended its name to be \"Eagle Hose & Hook & Ladder Company No. 6\". This is its formal name.\nAround 2005, the \"Eagle Hose\" began to restore its prized parade carriage, built by William Williams in 1859. It learned that the carriage was the last working fire hose wagon of the Eagle Hose Company No. 1 of the old New York (Brooklyn) City Volunteer Fire Department. The hose carriage was restored to its original color scheme when first built.\nIn 1875, residents in West Ansonia petitioned for powers of a fire association. The Connecticut General Assembly granted a charter establishing the West Ansonia Fire District, in the Town of Derby. On February 12, 1876 the West Ansonia Hose Company No. 1 was formally organized by the fire district. Shortly after its organization, the Company changed its name to \"Fountain Hose Company No. 1\", which it is still known by today. There are two stories of the name's origin. First is that it was named in honor of the Fountain Lake Water Company, which serviced the area. The secind is that it is in honor of the gift of a water fountain depicting a young girl and boy, which was presented to the company at the time of its organization.\nFrom their organization to 1894, the two companies operated independently although working close together. When Ansonia became a separate Town from Derby in 1889, the two fire departments continued to operate separately. The Borough of Ansonia financed the Eagle Hose, while the West Ansonia Fire District financed the Fountain Hose. Shortly after Ansonia was incorporated as a Town, the current street box fire alarm notification system was installed on the east side. The West Ansonia Fire District purchased a few fire alarm boxes for their district to be tied into the system.\nIn 1893, Ansonia was chartered as a city; it consolidated the separate Town and borough governments. With this, in 1894 the West Ansonia Fire District was merged into the Ansonia Fire Department. The Eagle Hose and Fountain Hose have been under the same board of fire commissioners and fire chiefs, while the companies kept their traditional incorporated names and numbers. The three other fire companies \"Webster Hose Co. #3\", \"Charters Hose Co. #4\" and \"Hilltop Hose Co #5\" were organized after Ansonia was incorporated a city.\nThe Ansonia Fire Department is currently composed of five all-volunteer fire companies operating out of five fire stations. Each volunteer fire company is commanded by a Captain and two or three Lieutenants (depending on the size of the Company). The A.F.D. is commanded by a Chief of Department and four Assistant Chiefs (one from each of the Companies) and governed by a Board of Fire Commissioners. The Ansonia Fire Department operates a fire apparatus fleet consisting of five engines, one tower-ladder truck, one rescue-squad truck, a utility unit along with several other support units. The current Chief of Department is Scott Trembley, from Charter hose Co. #4.\nThe Ansonia Fire Department also has an Office of the Fire Marshal and a Fire Alarm Superintendent Division (which maintains the street box alarm notification system). The Fire Marshall commands an investigation truck and a staff vehicle, and the Superintendent operates a utility bucket truck (also used by the Public Works Department).\nBelow is a complete listing of all fire station locations and apparatus in Ansonia.\nThe Ansonia Police Department was founded around 1880 when Ansonia was a borough in the Town of Derby and Daniel Hayes was appointed the first police chief of the department. Chief Hayes died in 1882 after he succumbed to his injuries day after when he was shot while making an arrest. The Police Department has 42 sworn officers and 12 civilian personnel. The Police Department is split between the patrol and detective divisions. The Police Department headquarters is located on Elm Street.\nIn addition to the Farrel Corporation and Ansonia Copper & Brass facilities along the banks of the Naugatuck River in the center of the city, Ansonia's landmarks include its public library (Ansonia Library), the Anna Sewell Memorial Fountain (honoring the author of\"Black Beauty\"), in front of the Library YMCA, National Guard Armory and many Victorian and Queen Anne houses. The prominent Ansonia Opera House is the oldest opera house in Connecticut built in 1870.\nAnsonia is noted for its many churches, including those forming five Catholic parishes, each historically associated with a particular ethnic group: Saint Joseph (Polish), Holy Rosary (Italian), Saint Anthony (Lithuanian; now combined with Holy Rosary), Our Lady of the Assumption (Irish), and Saints Peter and Paul (Ukrainian). There are also Congregationalist, Methodist, Episcopal, African Methodist Episcopal, Baptist, Russian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, Pentecostal, and other Christian denominations. The region's Sikh community had a gurdwara (temple) in one of the buildings on Main Street until an accidental fire burned it down.\nIn the mid-1930s, after its original high school that was located on Prospect Street (now a City park) burned down, Ansonia residents decided to build a new one on Howard Avenue. This is notable in that the building was designed by William Lescaze, one of the pioneers of modernism in American architecture, who was primarily known for his work in the Philadelphia area. When it opened in 1936, it was one of the first \"modern\" high school buildings in the country, and was, for its time, quite unique. By comparison, nearby Hamden High School was built at about the same time in a traditional, colonial design. \nToday the former high school is now the Ansonia Middle School. A new Ansonia High School was built at 20 Pulaski Highway in the Hilltop section of the city.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 1994, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1994, "length": 186, "sectionHeading": "History | Invention of America's first bicycle", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2180, "length": 2713, "sectionHeading": "History | 20th century to present", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4893, "length": 679, "sectionHeading": "History | 20th century to present | Rubber plant fire", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5572, "length": 1570, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7142, "length": 2162, "sectionHeading": "Geography | Neighborhoods", "sectionLabel": "city.district"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 9304, "length": 231, "sectionHeading": "Climate", "sectionLabel": "city.climate"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 9536, "length": 2049, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 11585, "length": 2210, "sectionHeading": "Economy", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 13795, "length": 517, "sectionHeading": "Transportation", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 14312, "length": 179, "sectionHeading": "Public safety", "sectionLabel": "city.law"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 14491, "length": 882, "sectionHeading": "Public safety | Emergency medical services", "sectionLabel": "city.district"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 15373, "length": 4096, "sectionHeading": "Public safety | Fire Department", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 19469, "length": 493, "sectionHeading": "Public safety | Police department", "sectionLabel": "city.law"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 19962, "length": 1873, "sectionHeading": "Landmarks", "sectionLabel": "city.sights"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooper,_Utah", "type": "city", "title": "Hooper, Utah", "abstract": "Hooper is a city in Weber County, Utah, United States, first called Muskrat Springs and later Hooperville for Captain William Henry Hooper, an early Utah delegate to Congress.

It is the largest city in Odisha and is a centre of economic and religious importance in Eastern India.\nAlong with the old town, the region, historically was often depicted as Ekamra Kshetra (Temple City). With the diverse ranges of heritage resources, it showcases significant sacred cultural landscape components which have evolved with the support of available natural resource base and cultural trigger.\nAlthough the modern city of Bhubaneswar was formally established only in 1948, the history of the areas in and around the present-day city can be traced to 3rd century BCE and earlier. It is a confluence of Hindu, Buddhist and Jain heritage boasting of some of the finest Kalingan temples. With many 6th-13th century CE Hindu temples, which span the entire spectrum of Kalinga architecture, Bhubaneswar is often referred to as a \"Temple City of India\". With Puri and Konark it forms the Swarna Tribhuja (\"Golden Triangle\"), one of eastern India's most visited destinations.\nBhubaneswar replaced Cuttack as the capital on 19 August 1949, 2 years after India gained its independence from Britain. The modern city was designed by the German architect Otto K\u00f6nigsberger in 1946. Along with Jamshedpur and Chandigarh, it was one of modern India's first planned cities. Bhubaneswar and Cuttack are often referred to as the 'twin cities of Odisha'. The metropolitan area formed by the two cities had a population of 1.7 million in 2011. Bhubaneswar is categorised as a Tier-2 city. An emerging information technology (IT) and education hub, Bhubaneswar is one of the country's fastest-developing cities.\n", "text": "From Odia \u0b2d \u0b2c\u0b28 \u0b36 \u0b71\u0b30 (bhubaneswara), a compound of \u0b2d \u0b2c\u0b28 (bhubana, \u201cearth\u201d) and \u0b08\u0b36 \u0b2c\u0b30 (iswara, \u201cthe almighty\u201d).\nBhubaneswar, derived its name from Tribhubaneswar, which literally means the Lord (Eeswar) of the Three World (Tribhuban), which refers to Lord Shiva. \nThe foundation of the modern Bhubaneswar city was laid in 1948, although the areas in and around the city have a history going back to 1st century BCE or earlier.\nDhauli, near Bhubaneswar was the site of the Kalinga War (c. 262-261 BCE), in which the Mauryan emperor Ashoka invaded and annexed Kalinga. One of the most complete edicts of the Mauryan Emperor, Ashoka, dating from between 272\u2013236 BCE, remains carved in rock to the southwest of the modern city. After the decline of the Mauryan empire, the area came under the rule of Mahameghavahana dynasty, whose most well-known rule is Kharavela. His Hathigumpha inscription is located at the Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves near Bhubaneswar. The area was subsequently ruled by several dynasties, including Satavahanas, Guptas, Matharas, and Shailodbhavas.\nIn 7th century, Somavamshi or Keshari dynasty established their kingdom in the area, and constructed a number of temples. After the Kesharis, the Eastern Gangas ruled Kalinga area until 14th century CE. Their capital Kalinganagar was located in present-day Bhubaneswar district. After them, Mukunda Deva of the Bhoi dynasty \u2013 the last Hindu ruler of the area until the Marathas \u2013 developed several religious buildings in the area. Most of the older temples in Bhubaneswar were built between 8th and 12th centuries, under Shaiva influence. The Ananta Vasudeva Temple is the only old temple of Vishnu in the city. In 1568, the Karrani dynasty of Afghan origin gained control of the area. During their reign, most of the temples and other structures were destroyed or disfigured.\nIn the 16th century, the area came under pachamani Mughal control. The Marathas, who succeeded the Mughals in mid-18th century, encouraged pilgrimage in the region. In 1803, the area came under British colonial rule, and was part of the Bengal Presidency (until 1912), Bihar and Orissa Province (1912-1936) and Orissa Province (1936-1947). The capital of the British-ruled Orissa Province was Cuttack, which was vulnerabile to floods and suffered from space constraints. Because of this, on 30 September 1946, a proposal to move the capital to a new capital was introduced in the Legislative Assembly of the Orissa Province. After independence of India, the foundation of the new capital was laid by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on 13 April 1948.\nThe name of the new capital came from \"Tribhubaneswar\" or \"Bhubaneswar\" (literally \"Lord of the Earth\"), a name of Shiva, the deity of the Lingaraja temple. The Legislative Assembly of Orissa was shifted from Cuttack to Bhubaneswar in 1949. Bhubaneswar was built as a modern city, designed by German architect Otto K\u00f6nigsberger with wide roads, gardens and parks. Though part of the city followed the plan, it grew rapidly over the next few decades, outstripping the planning process. According the first census of independent India, taken in 1951, the city's population was just 16,512. From 1952 to 1979, it was administered by a Notified Area Council or a nagar panchayat; a municipality was established only on 12 March 1979. By the 1991 census, the population of Bhubaneswar had increased to 411,542. Accordingly, on 14 August 1994, the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation was established.\nBhubaneswar is in Khordha district of Odisha. It is in the eastern coastal plains, along the axis of the Eastern Ghats mountains. The city has an average altitude of above sea level. It lies southwest of the Mahanadi River that forms the northern boundary of Bhubaneswar metropolitan area, within its delta.\nThe city is bounded by the Daya River to the south and the Kuakhai River to the east; the Chandaka Wildlife Sanctuary and Nandankanan Zoo lie in the western and northern parts of Bhubaneswar, respectively.\nBhubaneswar is topographically divided into western uplands and eastern lowlands, with hillocks in the western and northern parts. Kanjia lake on the northern outskirts, affords rich biodiversity and is a wetland of national importance. Bhubaneswar's soils are 65 per cent laterite, 25 per cent alluvial and 10 per cent sandstone. The Bureau of Indian Standards places the city inside seismic zone III on a scale ranging from I to V in order of increasing susceptibility to earthquakes. The United Nations Development Programme reports that there is \"very high damage risk\" from winds and cyclones. The 1999 Odisha cyclone caused major damage to buildings, the city's infrastructure and cost many human lives. Floods and waterlogging in the low-lying areas have become common due to unplanned growth.\nThe Bhubaneswar urban development area consists of the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation area, 173 revenue villages and two other municipalities spread over . The area under the jurisdiction of the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation covers . The city is somewhat dumbbell-shaped with most of the growth taking place to the north, northeast and southwest. The north\u2013south axis of the city is widest, at roughly . Growth in the east is restricted due to the presence of Kuakhai River and by the wildlife sanctuary in the northwestern part. The city can be broadly divided into the old town, planned city (or state capital), added areas and outer peripheral areas. It is subdivided into Units and Colonies.\nThe old town or \"Temple Town\", the oldest part of the city, is characterised by many temples, including the Lingaraj, Rajarani, and Muktesvara temples, standing alongside residential areas. This area is congested, with narrow roads and poor infrastructure. Among neighbourhoods in the old town are Rajarani Colony, Pandav Nagar, Brahmeswar Bagh, Lingaraj Nagar, Gouri Nagar, Bhimatanki and Kapileswar.\nThe planned city was designed in 1948 to house the capital. It is subdivided into units, each with a high school, shopping centres, dispensaries and play areas. While most of the units house government employees, Unit V houses the administrative buildings, including the State Secretariat, State Assembly, and the Raj Bhavan. Private residential areas were later built in other areas of the planned city, including Saheed Nagar and Satya Nagar. Unit I, popularly known as the Market Building, was formed to cater to the shopping needs of the new capital's residents. Later, markets and commercial establishments developed along the Janpath and Cuttack-Puri Road at Saheed Nagar, Satya Nagar, Bapuji Nagar and Ashok Nagar. A dedicated institutional area houses educational and research institutes, including Utkal University, the Institute of Physics, the Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology and Sainik School. Indira Gandhi Park, Gandhi Park and the Biju Patnaik Park are located in the unit.\nThe added areas are mostly areas lying north of National Highway 5, including Nayapalli, Jayadev Vihar, Chandrasekharpur and Sailashree Vihar, which were developed by Bhubaneswar Development Authority to house the growing population.\nThe peripheral areas are outside the municipal boundary or have subsequently been included within the extended boundary, including Tomando, Patia and Raghunathpur. Most of these areas were developed in a haphazard manner, without proper planning.\nBhubaneswar secured the top rank in the Smart city list in India.\nBhubaneswar has a tropical savanna climate, designated Aw under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification.

According to a 2012 survey, among the tier-2 cities in India, Bhubaneswar has been chosen as the best for conducting IT/ITES business. The government fostered growth by developing of IT parks such as Infocity-1, Infovalley, STPI-Bhubaneswar and JSS STP. Infocity was conceived as a five-star park, under the Export Promotion Industrial Parks (EPIP) Scheme to create infrastructure facilities for setting up information technology related industries. Infosys and Tech Mahindra have been present in Bhubaneswar since 1996.

Most of the region during this time was settled by the Wichita and Caddo peoples. Around the 1700s, two tribes from the North, the Comanches and Kiowas, migrated to the Oklahoma and Texas region.\nFor most of the 18th century, the Oklahoma region was under French control as part of Louisiana. In 1803, the Louisiana Purchase by Thomas Jefferson brought the area under United States control. In 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which removed American Indian tribes and relocated them to Indian Territory. The southern part of the territory was originally assigned to the Choctaw and Chickasaw, until the 1867 Medicine Lodge Treaty allotted the southwest portion of the Choctaw and Chickasaw\u2019s lands to the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache.\nThe City of Walters was organized on August 6, 1901, under the original name of McKnight, Indian Territory.

Craig is approximately by air northwest of Ketchikan and south of Juneau.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (28.94%) is water.\nOriginally, Craig's townsite was a temporary fishing camp used for gathering herring e.\nCraig was named after Craig Miller (also spelled Millar) who established a fish saltery on nearby Fish Egg Island in 1907 with the assistance of the local Haida natives who moved onto Prince of Wales Island, being driven from Haida Gwaii (British Columbia's Queen Charlotte Islands) starting in the 18th century. Craig Miller constructed a cold storage plant and packing company at the present site of Craig, and in 1922 was instrumental in the incorporation of the city (originally as an Alaska second-class city within the Alaska Territory, pre-statehood).\nThe commercial fishing industry was responsible for Craig's relatively large population compared to neighboring communities. In the 1930s, record pink salmon runs brought many new settlers. The 1950s saw a collapse of the fishing industry because of depleted salmon populations. In 1972, a large sawmill was established nearby providing a steady source of year-round employment. Today, Craig relies on commercial fishing, fish processing, and the timber industry.\nOn September 7, 1982, the fishing boat Investor was found burning off the coast of Craig, and the boat's passengers and crew were found to have been killed. Due to the badly burned state of the bodies, investigators were only certain that they had recovered the remains of seven bodies, but a coroner's jury ruled that all eight who were aboard the boat had been killed. The boat's owner, Mark Coulthurst, from Blaine, Washington, his wife Irene, and their two young children were among the victims.

There are two harbors in the center of town one which primarily contains smaller charter and recreational boats, and the North Cove Harbor where the trollers, seiners, longliners, shrimp, crab, and dive boats that make up the local fleet are moored. During the peak of the fishing season in summer, the harbor is usually so full that boats must anchor out in the bay.\nTourism provides jobs and income to the community. Many charter fishing lodges cater to guests who visit the island for the salmon fishing as well as black bear and deer hunting.\nThe other main employer in Craig is the U.S. Forest Service.

Richard Matson Brashear was the son of William G. Brashear, who is said to have been one of the first white settlers in the area in 1842. However, the Brashear community dates back prior to 1872 by several years. Approximately one mile north of the current location, there once stood a prosperous small village named Paulville, also known as Paultown, which was established around 1855 by a man named Walker Paul. Paulville served as a trading hub for the farms of eastern Adair County, along with several other businesses, one of which was a grist mill. Sometime during the Civil War, the grist mill was put to the torch to prevent Confederate recruits from being resupplied. The coming of the Quincy, Missouri & Pacific Railroad in 1872 saw a wholesale population shift. The building of a rail depot at the newly platted town of Brashear caused a very large portion of Paulville's population and business to migrate the short distance south. Through the latter half of the 19th century and first few decades of the 20th, Brashear's business district ebbed and flowed as many farm communities are wont to do. Similarly, the Great Depression and post-World War Two mobility of the American public led to many changes. In 1950 Brashear had a population of only 152, however that number has been on a slight rise ever since. A few business concerns remain today, but most residents travel west to Kirksville or east to Edina for their shopping and employment.\nBrashear is located at (40.147868, -92.377565).

In 1925 the first Brashear High School was destroyed by fire, but quickly rebuilt. By January 1965 all surrounding rural schools had been consolidated into the current R-2 District. \nNot long after the destruction of the first high school, a northern Missouri legend was born: the annual Brashear Basketball Tournament. The year 1918 saw the birth of organized school basketball at Brashear, and by 1927 the first tournament was held. Through good times and bad the tournament has persevered to become one of the oldest in Missouri. The Brashear Lady Tigers won back-to-back Missouri Class 1A state basketball titles in 2003 and 2004. On June 3, 2010 the Brashear Tigers baseball team competed in the Missouri Class 1A baseball championship game, taking second place.

The Indian agent was Colonel Return J. Meigs. Charleston and Blythe Ferry (about 15 miles, or 24 kilometers, northwest of Cleveland) would both figure prominently in the Cherokee Removal in the late 1830s.\nThe legislative act that created Bradley County in 1836 authorized the establishment of a county seat, which was to be named \"Cleveland\" after Colonel Benjamin Cleveland, a commander at the Battle of Kings Mountain during the American Revolution. The commissioners chose \"Taylor's Place,\" the home of Andrew Taylor, as the location for the county seat, due largely to the site's excellent water sources. By 1838, Cleveland already had a population of 400, and was home to two churches (one Presbyterian, the other Methodist), and a school, the Oak Grove Academy. The city was incorporated on February 4, 1842, and elections for mayor and aldermen were held shortly afterward. \nCleveland grew rapidly following the arrival of the railroad in the 1850s. While bitterly divided over the issue of secession on the eve of the Civil War, Cleveland, like Bradley County and most of East Tennessee, voted against Tennessee's Ordinance of Secession in June 1861. The railroad bridge over the Hiwassee River to the north was among those destroyed by the East Tennessee bridge-burning conspiracy in November 1861. Cleveland was occupied by the Confederate Army from 1861 to 1863.\nDuring the 1870s, Cleveland experienced a growth spurt. The city's most iconic building, Craigmiles Hall, was constructed in 1878 as an opera house and meeting hall. Numerous factories were also established, including the Hardwick Stove Company in 1879, the Cleveland Woolen Mills in 1880, and the Cleveland Chair Company in 1884. By 1890, the city was home to nine physicians, twelve attorneys, eleven general stores, fourteen grocery stores, three drug stores, three hardware stores, six butcher shops, two hatmakers, two hotels, a shoe store, and seven saloons. A mule-drawn trolley system was established in 1886, and the city had electricity by 1895. During this period, Cleveland's population more than doubled from 1,812 in 1880 to 3,643 in 1900.\nMany of the buildings currently standing in the downtown area, including those in the Centenary Avenue Historic District, were constructed between 1880 and 1915. In 1918, the Church of God, a Christian denomination headquartered in Cleveland, established a Bible school that would eventually become Lee University. Cleveland's Chamber of Commerce was established in 1925. The city experienced further growth when several major factories were constructed in the area following World War II. As a result, the city has expanded much to the north and northwest, and the business district is now located in the southern portion of town.\nCleveland is located in southeast Tennessee in the center of Bradley County situated among a series of low hills and ridges roughly west of the Blue Ridge Mountains and east of the Chickamauga Lake impoundment of the Tennessee River. The Hiwassee River, which flows down out of the mountains and forms the northern boundary of Bradley County, empties into the Tennessee a few miles northwest of Cleveland.

Several streams run in the valleys between the ridges including Candies Creek, located west of Clingan ridge, and South Mouse Creek, between Mouse Creek and Lead Mine Ridge.\nCleveland is divided into five major regions: Central Cleveland (also called Downtown Cleveland), Northern Cleveland (also called North Cleveland), Western Cleveland, East Cleveland, and South Cleveland. East and South Cleveland are census-designated places within the city limits. There are no official borders between the other divisions. Central Cleveland encompasses the business district and surrounding residential area including the Stuart Heights, Centenary Avenue, and Annadale neighborhoods. Northern Cleveland has come to be the location for most of the city's retail shops and private interests. In addition, it is a major residential division, made up of Burlington Heights, Fairview, and Sequoia Grove neighborhoods. Western Cleveland is entirely residential. Much of it is an extension of the city limits westward to encompass populous neighborhoods including Hopewell Estates and Rolling Hills. East and South Cleveland are both residential and industrial divisions. People living in East Cleveland tend to be less privileged. South Cleveland is the densest populated part of town. People who live in these regions are sometimes referred to as being \"isolated\" from the rest of the city, as they work in that part of town and most of their economy comes from retail and businesses in the southern part of the city. \nSeveral neighborhoods and communities are located within the city.

William Bean, traditionally recognized as Tennessee's first white settler, built his cabin at the mouth of Boone Creek, downstream from modern Watauga, in 1769. The Watauga Association, an early frontier government, operated out of nearby Elizabethton in the 1770s.\nWhen the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad (ET&V) was built in the 1850s, a railroad stop known as Carter's Depot, or Carter's Station, was established at what is now Watauga, where a trestle had been erected to carry the tracks across the Watauga River. Carter's Depot consisted of a water tank, several storage buildings, a telegraph office, and a post office.\nThe trestle at Carter's Depot held immense strategic importance during the Civil War, as the ET&V was part of a vital supply line connecting Virginia with the rest of the South. The trestle was among those targeted by the East Tennessee bridge burnings in November 1861, though the conspirators found it too heavily guarded by Confederates. In late December 1862, General Samuel P. Carter conducted a raid into the region, overwhelming the Confederate detachment at Carter's Depot before destroying the trestle. On October 1, 1864, a skirmish took place at Carter's Depot, with Union forces under General Alvan C. Gillem pushing Confederates led by John C. Vaughn across the river.\nWatauga is located at (36.367305, -82.291296) along the Watauga River, at the headwaters of Boone Lake, approximately river miles above the river's confluence with the South Fork Holston River.

The Romans conquered the area. The Romans built a road and rebuilt the fortress Acidava. The ruins of the fortress can be seen even today. The area was still inhabited after the retreat of the Roman legios.\nFrom the Middle Ages come the first written documents about the villages that now compose the town.\n- Bistri\u021ba Nou\u0103 is first atested in 1835. The name comes from the Bistri\u021ba Monastery. The land where is the village today was the property of the monastery. The village was also called Fle\u0219tenoagele or Fle\u0219cinogele.\n- Criva, also known as Criva de Jos, was atested on May 26, 1630, as a property of a local boyar, jupan Gorgan biv vel sp\u0103tar.

Note that these are intermediate values between road and railway distances.\nThe main village, Piatra, is placed near the train station and expands to South-East. It is divided into two parts: the eastern part (named Piatra Sat by the locals) and the western part, near the station, called Gar\u0103 (in English, station). Eno\u0219e\u0219ti is placed East from Piatra, on the 64 national road and is the road access way to Piatra. Criva is placed South-East from Piatra and has a small railway station.

The roads follow nearly the same path like the railways:\n- The national road DN 64 connects to South G\u0103neasa with Caracal and Corabia. To North, it continues to R\u00e2nicu V\u00e2lcea.\n- The national road DN 65, also known as E 574 (European road) connects G\u0103neasa to East with Pite\u0219ti and to West to Craiova.\nThe main occupation is related to the railway maintenance and transportation.

Martensville is currently one of only two cities in Saskatchewan without a local radio station, the other being Warman.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 592, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 592, "length": 211, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 803, "length": 1363, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2166, "length": 795, "sectionHeading": "Government", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2961, "length": 1452, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4413, "length": 861, "sectionHeading": "Points of interest", "sectionLabel": "city.sights"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5274, "length": 466, "sectionHeading": "Points of interest | Arts and culture", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5740, "length": 1315, "sectionHeading": "Sports", "sectionLabel": "city.sport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7055, "length": 653, "sectionHeading": "Infrastructure", "sectionLabel": "city.infrastructure"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7708, "length": 321, "sectionHeading": "Media", "sectionLabel": "city.media"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarnia", "type": "city", "title": "Sarnia", "abstract": "Sarnia is a city in Southwestern Ontario, Canada, and had a 2016 population of 71,594. It is the largest city on Lake Huron and in Lambton County. Sarnia is located on the eastern bank of the junction between the Upper and Lower Great Lakes where Lake Huron flows into the St. Clair River, which forms the Canada\u2013United States border, directly across from Port Huron, Michigan. The city's natural harbour first attracted the French explorer La Salle, who named the site \"The Rapids\" when he had horses and men pull his barque \"Le Griffon\" up the almost four-knot current of the St. Clair River on 23 August 1679.\nThis was the first time anything other than a canoe or other oar-powered vessel had sailed into Lake Huron, and La Salle's voyage was thus germinal in the development of commercial shipping on the Great Lakes. Located in the natural harbour, the Sarnia port remains an important centre for lake freighters and oceangoing ships carrying cargoes of grain and petroleum products. The natural port and the salt caverns that exist in the surrounding areas, together with the oil discovered in nearby Oil Springs in 1858 led to the massive growth of the petroleum industry in this area. Because Oil Springs was the first place in Canada and North America to drill commercially for oil, the knowledge that was acquired there led to oil drillers from Sarnia travelling the world teaching other nations how to drill for oil.\nThe complex of refining and chemical companies is called Chemical Valley and located south of downtown Sarnia. While in 2011 the city had the highest level of particulates air pollution of any Canadian city, it has since dropped down to 30th. About 60 percent of the particulate matter, however, comes from the neighboring United States. Lake Huron is cooler than the air in summer and warmer than the air in winter; therefore, it moderates Sarnia's humid continental climate, which makes temperature extremes of hot and cold less evident. In the winter, Sarnia occasionally experiences lake-effect snow from Arctic air blowing across the warmer waters of Lake Huron and condensing to form snow squalls once over land.\nCulturally, Sarnia is a large part of the artistic presence in Southern Ontario. The city's International Symphony Orchestra is renowned in the area and has won the Outstanding Community Orchestra Award given by the Detroit Music Awards in 2011. Michael Learned graced the stage of the Imperial Theatre for a 2010 production of Driving Miss Daisy. Sarnia Bayfest, which used to be the largest event in Sarnia annually, was a popular music festival that took place during the summer. In 2013, organizers cancelled the event because of money troubles but are taking an \"indefinite hiatus\" while planning for the future.\n", "text": "The name \"Sarnia\" is Latin for Guernsey, which is a British Channel Island. In 1829 Sir John Colborne, a former governor of Guernsey, was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. In this capacity, he visited two small settlements in 1835 that had been laid out on the shores of Lake Huron. One of these, named \"The Rapids,\" consisted then of 44 taxpayers, nine frame houses, four log houses, two brick dwellings, two taverns and three stores. The villagers wished to change its name but were unable to agree on an alternative. The English settlers favoured the name \"Buenos Aires\" and the Scottish \"New Glasgow\". Sir John Colborne suggested Port Sarnia. On 4 January 1836, the name was formally adopted by a vote of 26 to 16, and Colborne also named the nearby village Moore after British military hero Sir John Moore. Sarnia adopted the nickname \"The Imperial City\" on 7 May 1914 because of the visit of Canada's Governor General, H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, and his daughter Princess Patricia.\nFirst Nations peoples have lived, hunted, and traveled across the area for at least 10,000 years, as shown by archaeological evidence on Walpole Island. About A.D. 796, these peoples emerged from an amalgamation of Ojibwa, Odawa, and Potowatami clans, and formed the Three Fires Confederacy, also called the Council of Three Fires, . They were all speakers of Algonquian languages and also had connections through common elements of cultures. They developed a self-sufficient society where tasks and responsibilities were equally shared among all members.\nBy the time of the 1600s and 1700s, The Three Fires Confederacy controlled much of the area known as the hub of the Great Lakes, which included the Canadian shore where Sarnia is now located. During this time, it maintained relations with many of the First Nations, including Huron, Lakota (Sioux), and Iroquois, as well as the countries of Great Britain and France. Both of the latter nations had colonists and missionaries in North America, particularly closer to the Atlantic coasts and related waterways. The Confederacy's trading partners, the Huron, welcomed La Salle and the Griffon in 1679 after he sailed into Lake Huron. The Ontario Heritage Trust erected a historical plaque under the Blue Water Bridge in commemoration of the voyage, as shown in the photo.\nBecause of this beginning of the incursion of Europeans into the area, the members of the Confederacy helped shape the development of North America throughout the 18th century, becoming a centre of trade and culture. Britain tried to strengthen relations with the tribes in the area as a set of allies against the French and the Iroquois, based mostly east and south of lakes Ontario and Erie. The people of the Three Fires Confederacy, however, sided with the French during the Seven Years' War and made peace with Great Britain only after the Treaty of Fort Niagara in 1764. The Confederacy fought on the side of the British during the War of 1812, hoping the expel the Americans from the Great Lakes hub. \nThe Three Fires Confederacy broke several treaties with the United States prior to 1815, but finally signed the Treaty of Springwells in September of that year and ceased all hostilities directed at the US. The Grand Council survived intact until the middle to late 19th century, when more modern political systems began to develop.\nBefore the War of 1812, the first Europeans in the area were French-Canadian settlers loyal to the British Crown. Some had been in the area east and west of the Detroit and St. Clair rivers since before the British took over this territory. In this period, Detroit was still within the British colony of the Province of Quebec. Ignace Cazelet, Joseph La Forge, and Jean-Baptiste Par\u00e9 are credited as the first settlers of Sarnia in about 1807-1810; their role is marked by an historic plaque installed by the Ontario Heritage Society. They were fur traders with the Huron and Three Fires Confederacy, and later farmers, attracting other settlers and stimulating growth in the area. \nThe township was surveyed in 1829, and in the early 1830s there were numerous Scottish immigrants to this area. After its foundation, Port Sarnia expanded throughout the 19th century; on 19 June 1856, Parliament passed An Act to Incorporate the Town of Sarnia and the name Port Sarnia was officially changed to Sarnia, effective 1 January 1857. The Act mentioned 1,000 inhabitants in three wards. The wealth of adjoining stands of timber supported the lumber industry at a time of development throughout this Great Lakes area, with lumber also in demand in the growing cities of Chicago and Detroit. \nIn addition, the discovery of oil in nearby Oil Springs in 1858 by James Miller Williams, and the arrival of the Great Western Railway in 1858 and the Grand Trunk Railway in 1859 all stimulated Sarnia's growth. The rail lines were later linked directly to the United States by the opening of the St. Clair Tunnel under the St. Clair River at Sarnia in 1890, by the Grand Trunk Railway. This was the first railroad tunnel ever constructed under a river. The tunnel was an engineering marvel in its day, achieved through the development of original techniques for excavating in a compressed air environment.\nCanada Steamship Lines formed in 1913 from many previous companies that plied the waters of the St. Clair River. One of these companies was Northwest Transportation Company of Sarnia, which was founded in 1870. By 20 April 1914, when Parliament passed An Act to Incorporate the City of Sarnia, the population had grown to 10,985 in six wards. Sarnia officially became a city as of 7 May 1914.\nSarnia's grain elevator, which in the early 21st century is the 15th-largest operating in Canada, was built in 1927 after the dredging of Sarnia Harbour in order to allow access to larger ships. Two years later, grain shipments had become an important part of Sarnia's economy. \nThe grain elevator rises above the harbour, and next to it is the slip for the numerous bulk carriers and other ships that are part of the contemporary shipping industry. They include vessels from all over the world. The waterway between Detroit and Sarnia is one of the world's busiest, as indicated by the average of of shipping that annually travelled the river going in both directions during the period 1993\u20132002. Lake freighters and oceangoing ships, which are known as \"salties,\" pass up and down the river at the rate of about one every seven minutes during the shipping season. \nThe Paul M. Tellier Tunnel, which was named after the retired president of CN in 2004, was bored and began operation in 1995. It accommodates double-stacked rail cars and is located next to the original tunnel, which has been sealed.\nWhile there had been a petroleum industry in the Sarnia area since 1858, the establishment of Polymer Corporation in 1942 to manufacture synthetic rubber during World War II was a great success. It began Sarnia's rise as a major petrochemical centre. Because of Sarnia's importance in this industry, the United States Government included it on its list of possible Soviet targets, developed as part of its Anti-Energy nuclear strike strategy during the Cold War.\nOn 1 January 1991, Sarnia and the neighbouring town of Clearwater (formerly Sarnia Township) were amalgamated as the new city of Sarnia-Clearwater. The amalgamation was originally slated to include the village of Point Edward, although that village's residents resisted. They were eventually permitted to remain independent of the city. On 1 January 1992, the city reverted to the name Sarnia.\nSarnia's population underwent continual growth from 1961 to 1991, with a 1991 population of 74,376. In 2001 the population had declined by approximately 3,000. Since 2001 Sarnia's population has been growing slowly, with a 2011 population count of 72,366. Despite these gains, an April 2010 report \"Sarnia-Lambton's Labour Market\" states: \"Large petrochemical companies are the community's main economic drivers. Over the recent past, several plants have shutdown,[sic] and of those still in operation, increased automation and outsourcing has led to significantly fewer workers.\" \nThese shutdowns and the resulting loss of jobs, and therefore of population as workers search for employment elsewhere, will contribute to a general decline, as forecast by an August 2011 study. It projects a 17% decline in population over the next twenty-five years. The Monteith-Brown study cited outlines a plan for restructuring the city based on hybrid zoning areas, which will bring work opportunities closer to the neighborhoods where people live. The City of Sarnia and Lambton County are also implementing an economic development plan with an emphasis on bio-industries and renewable energy.\nSarnia is located on the eastern shore of Lake Huron at its extreme southern point where it flows into the St. Clair River. Most of the surrounding area is flat, and the elevation ranges from and above sea level. The soil mostly comprises clay. Despite this high percentage of clay, the soil is remarkably rich for cultivation. Prior to the Ice Age, glaciers covered most of the area, as can be seen not only by the existence of the Great Lakes themselves but also of alluvial sand deposits, terminal moraines, and rich oil reserves. The entire area was submerged and plant and animal matter formed many layers of sediment as they settled after the waters receded. Sarnia is not part of the Canadian Shield and is located just beyond its southernmost reaches, west of Toronto and north of Detroit.\nWiltshire Park, Woodland, Oak Acres, Wees Beach, Oakwood Corners, Woodrow Shores, and Blackwell, are part of the North End of Sarnia, which begins immediately north of Ontario Highway 402 and terminates at the shore of Lake Huron. Coronation Park, Heritage Park, College Park, The Tree Streets, and Sherwood Village are some of the neighbourhoods south of the highway.\nThe village of Blue Water was built to house workers and their families in Chemical Valley during the construction of Polymer Corporation and at one point had nearly 3,000 residents. In 1961, all the residents were relocated, mostly to the North End, to make way for expansion of the chemical industry. The village was demolished, and all that remains now is an historical marker at the corner of Vidal Street and Huron Avenue. This neighbourhood was largely forgotten until historian Lorraine Williams penned two books about it and was instrumental in the dedication of the plaque.\nSarnia has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfb). Winters are cold with a few short-lasting Arctic air masses that dip far enough south and bring with them daily high temperatures lower than . Sarnia, while not quite located in the southwestern Ontario snowbelt, sometimes receives large quantities of lake-effect snow. Sarnia averages of snow per year, while London averages .\nThe lake creates a seasonal lag, and compared to the rest of Canada and inland Ontario, Sarnia has a noticeably longer warm period following summer. However, cooler temperatures tend to prevail for longer after winter. Lake Huron can also create large temperature differences within the city in spring and early summer, particularly on hot days in late May and early June. Finally, extreme temperatures, particularly lows, are rarely ever seen. Daily lows less than are seen an average of 30 days a year, and less than two days a year. Summers are warm to hot and usually humid. Humidex readings can be very high at times from late May to late September. In fact, Sarnia has the second greatest number of high humidex days at or above (with 23.16 days on average per year) and humidex days at or above (with 61.20 days on average per year) in Canada, both after Windsor, Ontario. Thunderstorms can become quite severe from April to September. Destructive weather is very rare in the area but has occurred, such as the tornado event of 1953.\nIn the 2016 Census, the City of Sarnia had a population of 71,594, a decrease of 1.1% from the 2011 Census. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.\nIn 2011, Sarnia had an overwhelmingly white population; only % were visible minorities, and % were Aboriginal. In 2011, % of Sarnians called English their mother tongue, % listed French, % stated both of those languages, and % said another language was their mother tongue.\nThe median age in Sarnia is 43.9 which is older than the Canadian median of 41.0, indicative of Sarnia's aging population. According to the 2011 Census, Sarnia is predominately Christian as % of the population were Catholic, % were members of the United Church of Canada, % were Anglican, and % were of other Christian faiths, Muslim, or Jewish; % professed no religious preference or were atheists. The median income counting all persons 15 years old or older in Sarnia in 2010 was $29,196, while median family income was $76,523, both of which were slightly lower than average for Ontario, at $30,526 and $80,987, respectively. The cost of living in Sarnia, however, is significantly lower than it is in Ontario as a whole. The median value of a dwelling, for instance, is $179,266, compared to the $300,862 of Ontario as a whole.\nThe Sarnia-Lambton Workforce Development Board states in its March 2011 Labour Market Report that: \"Even though employment in both the petrochemical and agricultural industries has declined significantly in recent years, these two industries remain central drivers of the Sarnia Lambton economy.\"\nWhen World War II threatened tropical sources of natural latex for rubber, Sarnia was selected as the site to spearhead development of synthetic petroleum-based rubbers for war materials, and Polymer Corporation was built by Dow Chemical at the request of the Government of Canada. Large pipelines bring Alberta oil to Sarnia, where oil refining and petrochemical production have become mainstays of the city's economy. Shell Canada, Imperial Oil, and Suncor Energy (Sunoco) operate refineries in Sarnia. Large salt beds found under the city became a source of chlorine and other significant ingredients which contributed to the success of Chemical Valley. Chemical companies operating in Sarnia include NOVA Chemicals, Bayer (Lanxess and H.C. Starck), Cabot Corporation and Ethyl Corporation.\nDow ceased operations at its Sarnia site in 2009. The plant was decommissioned, and the land has been sold to neighbouring TransAlta Energy Corporation. TransAlta produces power and steam for industry, and is the largest natural gas co-generation plant in Canada. It has created the Bluewater Energy Park on the former Dow site. Lanxess produces more than of butyl rubber annually at its Sarnia location, and is the sole producer of regulatory-approved, food-grade butyl rubber, used in the manufacture of chewing gum. Within the boundaries of its Sarnia plant Lanxess has also created the Bio-industrial Park Sarnia.\nChemical Valley and the surrounding area are home to 62 facilities and refineries. These industrial complexes are the heart of Sarnia's infrastructure and economy. They directly employ nearly 8,000, and contribute to almost 45,000 additional jobs in the area. In 1971, the Canadian government deemed this area so important to the economic development of the country that it printed an image of a Sarnia Oil Refinery on the reverse of the Canadian $10 note. The huge industrial area is the cause of significant air and water pollution. The Canada Wide Daily Standard for airborne particulate matter and ozone pollution, regulation PM2.5, is 30 micrograms per cubic metre. Forty-five percent of this particulate air pollution in Sarnia comes from Chemical Valley, and the rest drifts over the St. Clair River from the neighbouring United States in the form of what is known as \"Transboundary Air Pollution.\"\nSarnia is the location of Enbridge's Sarnia Photovoltaic Power Plant. The facility went into full commercial operation in December 2009, with 20 MW of power. s of September 2010 , the plant was the largest photovoltaic (PV) solar power generation facility in the world, putting out 97 MW.\nThe 80-acre Western University Research Park, Sarnia-Lambton Campus was established in 2003 by the University of Western Ontario as a joint initiative with the County of Lambton and the City of Sarnia. The park is also the location of the Bioindustrial Innovation Centre, Canada's centre for the commercialization of industrial biotechnology.\nIn 2015, BioAmber opened a $141 million plant that manufactures of succinic acid per year, a chemical used to make plastics, lubricants, paint, cosmetics, food additives, and other products. BioAmber plans to construct a second site and may build it in Sarnia. Solutions4CO2 is developing a 4,645 square metre demonstration facility at Bluewater Energy Park. This company captures waste gas/water streams to process into value-added co-products, pharmaceutical drugs, and biofuels. PlantForm Corporation, a Canadian biotech startup company producing ultra-low-cost therapeutic antibody drugs, opened an office at the Western University Research Park in 2011. At the same Park, from the summer of 2012 to the summer of 2016, KmX Corporation operated a pilot plant to produce membranes that filter wastewater from industrial processes. KmX production in Sarnia has since moved to Ottawa and Edmonton.\nSarnia has two large malls: Lambton Mall with 72 stores, and the Bayside Centre with 9 stores, and several government and medical services. These large malls combine with several smaller shopping centres, discount stores, dollar stores, convenience stores, and a collection of antique and specialty stores to form the crux of Sarnia's retail business. Travellers can choose from eight branded and many family-owned hotels and motels.\nThe Blue Water Bridge links Sarnia and its neighbouring village of Point Edward to the city of Port Huron in the United States. It spans the St. Clair River, which connects Lake Huron to Lake St. Clair. The bridge's original three-lane span, opened in 1938, was twinned on 22 July 1997, making the bridge the fourth busiest border crossing in Ontario. The Blue Water Bridge border crossing makes use of both the NEXUS (frequent traveler program) and the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) program. Linking Highway 402 with the American Interstate 94 (I-94) and I-69, the bridge forms part of the NAFTA Superhighway, and is one of the most important gateways on the north\u2013south truck routes.\nPublic transportation within the City of Sarnia, including conventional bus transit, transportation of people with disabilities, transportation support for major events, and charter services, is provided by Sarnia Transit. From the city's local airport, Sarnia Chris Hadfield Airport, Air Georgian operates services to and from Toronto Pearson International Airport on behalf of Air Canada Express. For rail travel, Sarnia is one of the two western termini, along with Windsor, of the Via Rail Quebec City \u2013 Windsor Corridor, over which a service departs Sarnia station in the morning and arrives in the evening.\nSarnia is served by Bluewater Health, a hospital with 188 acute care beds, 70 complex continuing care beds and 27 rehabilitation beds. The hospital opened in 2010, following the amalgamation of several smaller facilities. Bluewater Health was recently recognized by Healthcare Insurance Reciprocal of Canada, one of the country's largest hospital insurers, for its continued improvement in patient safety and care quality.\nSarnia's musical and theatrical presence in Southern Ontario is significant. The International Symphony Orchestra plays at the Imperial Theatre for an annual season lasting from September to April. In addition to symphonic concerts, the Imperial Theatre offers year-round dramatic productions; Michael Learned played the lead in Driving Miss Daisy at the theatre in 2010. Former Max Webster frontman Kim Mitchell has returned to his hometown on occasion to play a concert, including his visit in 2008 for Sarnia's popular Ribfest, a competition where local amateur chefs share their recipes for barbecued ribs and compete against each other. Canadian composer and music educator Raymond Murray Schafer was born in Sarnia and developed his radical schizophonia techniques there.\nThe Sarnia Bayfest (which was preceded by the \"Festival by the Bay\") was an annual concert festival that features big-name rock and country bands, typically during the second or third weekend of July. Musicians and groups such as Aerosmith, KISS, Keith Urban, Jon Bon Jovi and Rascal Flatts have played at the event. The year 2013 would have marked the fifteenth anniversary of Bayfest, but financial problems caused the event's cancellation. Organizers stated that it is \"not the end\" and that they planned on coming back on solid financial footing sometime in the future. s of December 2013 , intent was announced to merge with the International Powerboat Festival for a joint event in 2015.\nBesides the single museum in Sarnia proper, six other museums in the local area document Sarnia's history, including its legacy as the home of the North American Oil Industry. Gallery Lambton offers 12 annual art exhibitions. In 2012 the Judith and Norman Alex Art Gallery opened. It is an international Category A art gallery, featuring exhibitions of Canadian art history, including paintings from the Group of Seven.\nDuring the Christmas season, the city of Sarnia presents the annual \"Celebration of Lights\" in Centennial Park. The event was created in 1984 by Dr. Wills Rawana and a committee funded by the retail chain Hudson's Bay, and the national telecommunications company Telus. From modest beginnings the event has garnered numerous awards as it has grown, including second place in the 2002 Canadian Government's Canada WinterLights competition. The Celebration was incorporated in its national prizewinning year and is now run by a voluntary Board of Directors.\nThere are over 100 parks in Sarnia, the largest being Canatara Park, which covers over 200 acres along the shore of Lake Huron. Canatara is an Ojibwe word that means Blue Water. The park was opened 24 May 1933. Within the park is Lake Chipican, a haven for 280 different species of birds on their migration routes. The park also maintains a Children's Animal Farm as part of Sarnia's commitment to wildlife. The annual \"Christmas on the Farm\" weekend event held at the Farm in early December is a popular community event enjoyed by families. Canatara Park is one of the first parks in southern Ontario to feature an outdoor fitness equipment installation.\nThe largest recreational park in Sarnia is Germain Park, which incorporates five baseball diamonds, four soccer fields, an outdoor pool, and the Community Gardens. As a memorial to Canadian aviators who gave their lives in World War II, one of the remaining Canadair Sabres in Canada is on display in the park.\nCentennial Park was opened on Dominion Day in 1967, as part of Canada's centenary celebrations. The City of Sarnia decided in 2013 to close much of Centennial Park, after the discovery of toxic lead and asbestos in the soil.\nSarnia has one remaining museum within its city limits, \"Stones 'N Bones\", which houses over 6,000 exhibits. The collection includes rocks, artifacts, fossils, and bones from all over the world. A previous museum, the Discovery House Museum, has been converted into a hospice. This historic house, built between 1869 and 1875, is recognized as a testament to Victorian Era construction.\nThe city's sandy fresh water beaches are a popular tourist attraction, while the sheltered harbour houses marinas for recreational sailing. Since 1925, the Mackinac race from Sarnia/Port Huron to Mackinac Island at the north end of the lake has been the highlight of the sailing season, drawing more than 3,000 sailors each year.\nSarnia's fresh-cut fries are another popular tourist attraction, and thousands of visitors annually visit the chip trucks parked under the Blue Water Bridge. Niagara-based cookbook author and food e-magazine publisher Lynn Ogryzlo visited the chip trucks in August 2012 and stated \"I was blown away by Sarnia,\" not only by the city's waterfront, where the chip trucks are located, but also by the chip trucks themselves. She also published an article in her e-magazine, The Ontario Table, recognizing the outstanding quality of the fresh-cut fries. Guelph-based travel writer Pat Brennan also recognized the quality of Sarnia's fries in his 2007 piece \"Sarnia Boasts Best Fries in the World.\" In 2012, Sarnia officials even created a special detour to reach the chip trucks during a period of construction. Realizing the popularity of Sarnia's chip trucks, the Ontario Medical Association includes them in a campaign to have fries and other junk food labelled for being dangerous in the same manner as cigarettes.\nSarnia is home to the Sarnia Sting, a junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League. Dino Ciccarelli, a former NHL player, was a part owner of the team. Former Sting player Steven Stamkos was selected first overall in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft by the Tampa Bay Lightning, and was followed by Nail Yakupov in 2012. Sarnia is also home to the Sarnia Legionnaires ice hockey team, which plays in the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League. The team is successor to the Sarnia Legionnaires (1954\u20131970), who won five Western Jr. 'B' championships and four Sutherland Cups during 16 seasons in the Ontario Hockey Association.\nSarnia has a successful tradition in Canadian football. As members of the Ontario Rugby Football Union, the local team Sarnia Imperials twice won the Grey Cup, in 1934 and 1936. The modern Sarnia Imperials are a semi-professional team playing in the Northern Football Conference.\nMike Ceresia is a Sarnia Native and he won 5 IRF World Racquetball Championships and competed in 8 consecutive World Championships from 1988 - 2002.\nThe Sarnia-born world champion curler Steve Bice played as alternate for the Glenn Howard rink in the 2007 Tim Hortons Brier and 2007 Ford World Men's Curling Championship, winning both times.\nSarnia City Council consists of nine elected members: the Mayor, four members from the city, and four members from the county. The Mayor and all Council members are elected to four-year terms. The four Lambton County Council members serve both County and City Council.\nThe current mayor, Mike Bradley, has held the position since December 1988 and is currently the second longest-serving mayor in the province of Ontario behind Milton's Gord Krantz. Past mayors of the city have included Andy Brandt, Marceil Saddy, Paul Blundy, Thomas George Johnston, and Alexander Mackenzie, the second Prime Minister of Canada.\nAt the provincial level, Sarnia is located within the Sarnia\u2014Lambton provincial electoral district, represented in 2013 by Bob Bailey, a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario. At the federal level, Sarnia is located within the Sarnia\u2014Lambton federal electoral district which in 2013 was represented by Patricia Davidson of the Conservative Party of Canada.\nOver the past 50 years, Sarnia's voters have been moderate, and the party affiliation of its Members of Parliament, both provincial and federal, has swung back and forth largely between the Liberal and Progressive Conservative parties (a New Democrat was elected in their 1990 provincial wave).\nThe Lambton Kent District School Board is responsible for the 13 elementary and three secondary public schools (Northern Collegiate Institute and Vocational School, Alexander MacKenzie Secondary School, and Great Lakes Secondary School) located within Sarnia's boundaries.\nThe St. Clair Catholic District School Board is responsible for the city's seven elementary and only secondary Catholic, St. Patrick's. In 2014, St. Patrick's and St. Christopher's merged, under the St. Patrick's name, on St. Christopher's North Sarnia site.\nThe Conseil scolaire catholique de Providence (CSC Providence) represents the two French Catholic schools in the city, Saint-Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier and Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin, while the Conseil scolaire Viamonde operates two French public schools, the elementary \u00c9cole Les Rapides and the secondary \u00c9cole Secondaire Franco-Jeunesse. There are also two independent Christian elementary schools in Sarnia\u2014Sarnia Christian School and Temple Christian Academy.\nLambton College, which offers two-year programs and diplomas, is one of Ontario's 21 colleges of applied arts and technology. It has a full-time enrolment of 3,500 and a part-time enrolment of about 8,000. It is the city's only post-secondary school.\nThere are four radio stations that originate from Sarnia, although other stations rebroadcast their signal there, notably CKTI-FM, a First Nations produced station from Kettle Point, and CBEG-FM and CBEF-3-FM, simulcasts of CBC Radio One and Ici Radio-Canada Premi\u00e8re, respectively, from Windsor, Ontario.\n- CHOK, country/news/sports\n- CFGX-FM The Fox, adult contemporary\n- CHOK-1-FM (rebroadcaster of CHOK AM)\n- CHKS-FM, active rock\nSome stations from Windsor, Detroit, and London can also be received.\nSarnia does not have a network television station of its own, although it has a community channel on Cogeco, which is the cable television provider in Sarnia.

The city contained Lake Furukawanuma until the 2011 tsunami destroyed it. Parts of the coastal area of the city are within the borders of the Sanriku Fukk\u014d National Park. Rikuzentakata has a humid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa) bordering on a oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb) with warm summers and cold winters. The average annual temperature in is 11.1 \u00b0C. The average annual rainfall is 1343 mm with September as the wettest month and January as the driest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 23.7 \u00b0C, and lowest in January, at around 0.0 \u00b0C.\nPer Japanese census data, the population of Rikuzentakata has declined steadily over the past 40 years.\nThe area of present-day Rikuzentakata was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the J\u014dmon period. The area was inhabited by the Emishi people, and came under the control of the Yamato dynasty during the early Heian period. During the Sengoku period, the area was dominated by various samurai clans before coming under the control of the Date clan during the Edo period, who ruled Sendai Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate.\nThe towns of Kesen and Takata were established within Kesen District on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipality system. The area was devastated by the 1896 Sanriku earthquake and the 1933 Sanriku earthquake. Kesen and Takata merged with the neighboring town of Hirota and villages of Otomo, Takekoma, Yokota and Yonezaki on January 1, 1955 to form the city of Rikuzentakata.\nRikuzentakata was almost completely destroyed by the tsunami following the T\u014dhoku earthquake. According to the police, every building smaller than three stories high was completely flooded, with buildings bigger than three stories high being flooded partially, one of the buildings being the city hall, where the water also reached as high as the third floor. The Japan Self-Defense Forces initially reported that between 300 and 400 bodies were found in the town.\nOn 14 March, an illustrated BBC report showed a picture of the town, describing it as \"almost completely flattened.\" The town's tsunami shelters were designed for a wave of three to four metres in height, but the tsunami of March 2011 created a wave 13 metres high which inundated the designated safe locations. Local officials estimated that 20% to 40% of the town's population has been killed. Although the town was prepared for earthquakes and tsunamis and had a 6.5 metre high seawall, it was not enough and more than 80% of 8,000 houses were swept away.\nA BBC film dated 20 March reported that the harbour gates of the town failed to shut as the tsunami approached, and that 45 young firemen were swept away while attempting to close them manually. The same film reported that 500 bodies had been recovered in the town, but that 10,000 people were still unaccounted-for out of a population of 26,000. As of 3 April 2011, 1,000 people from the town were confirmed dead with 1,300 still missing. In late May 2011, an Australian reporter interviewed a surviving volunteer firefighter who said 49 firefighters were killed in Rikuzentakata by the tsunami, among 284 firefighters known to have died along the affected coast, many while closing the doors of the tsunami barriers along the seashore.\nSixty-eight city officials, about one-third of the city's municipal employees, were killed. The town's mayor, Futoshi Toba, was at his post at the city hall and survived, but his wife was killed at their seaside home. The wave severely damaged the artifact and botanical collection at the city's museum and killed all six staff. The final death toll was 1656 killed and 223 missing and presumed dead. Portions of the city subsided by over a meter.\nAs a countermeasure against future tsunami, Rikuzentakata's city centre is being elevated upon rock fill in a megaproject. In 2014, a massive conveyor belt system was being used to carry rock from a hill across the Kesen River from the city centre. The conveyor belt system features a long suspension span that crosses the Kesen River, and is named the \"Bridge of Hope.\" The project is expected to elevate the city over 10 metres, and may be finished by 2018.\nRikuzentakata has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 18 members.\nThe local economy of Rikuzentakata is based heavily on commercial fishing and food processing. As of 2011, oyster farming produced \u00a540 million in annual sales for the city.\nRikuzentakata has eight public elementary schools and three public junior high schools operated by the city government, and one public high school operated by the Iwate Prefectural Board of Education. There is also one private high school.\nTakata-matsubara (\u9ad8\u7530\u677e\u539f ) was a two-kilometre stretch of shoreline that was lined with approximately seventy thousand pines. In 1927 it was selected as one of the 100 Landscapes of Japan (Sh\u014dwa era) and in 1940 it was designated a Place of Scenic Beauty. After the 2011 tsunami a single, ten-metre, two-hundred-year-old tree remained from the forest. Due to land subsidence and coastal erosion this was only five metres from the sea and was at threat from increased salinity. The Association for the Protection of Takata-Matsubara along with the municipal and prefectural governments took measures, including the erection of barriers, to protect the surviving pine.\nAs of September 2011, there were signs that these measures had failed, and that the tree was dead due to salt water poisoning. In September 2012, the tree was felled for preservation and replaced in 2013 with an artificial \"commemorative tree\".\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 726, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 726, "length": 104, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 830, "length": 853, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1683, "length": 2670, "sectionHeading": "History | 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4353, "length": 132, "sectionHeading": "Government", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4485, "length": 173, "sectionHeading": "Economy", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4658, "length": 240, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4898, "length": 910, "sectionHeading": "Local attractions | Takata-matsubara", "sectionLabel": "city.tourism"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madill,_Oklahoma", "type": "city", "title": "Madill, Oklahoma", "abstract": "Madill is a city and county seat of Marshall County, Oklahoma, United States.

Taliaferro, who had settled in 1886, in what was then known as Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation, Indian Territory. Taliaferro owned a farm and operated some ranches in the nearby town of Oakland, northwest of Madill. Oakland had been the area's largest town, but the railroad caused Madill to grow and Oakland, two miles northwest, to decline. A post office was established at Madill on April 29, 1901, The city was chartered on September 12, 1902. The first public school opened in a four-room frame structure built on the south side of the town in 1903.\nFarming and ranching became the town's principal industries early in its history because the surrounding area was highly fertile and the railroad provided good transportation to markets. There were also mineral springs nearby, and an oil seep north of town. The Arbuckle oilfield was discovered in 1904, and experienced another boom in 1924. Pure Oil Company brought in a well east of town in 1939 and built a company town called Pure Camp to house the oilfield workers. Pure Camp was destroyed by a tornado and killed two people on April 2, 1957. The camp closed permanently in July, 1959. \nMadill is located at (34.091261, -96.773565).

As of the 2010 census, the population was 137,436.\nAs one of the seven major cities that compose the Hampton Roads metropolitan area, it is on the southeastern end of the Virginia Peninsula.\nHampton traces its history to the city's Old Point Comfort, the home of Fort Monroe for almost 400 years, which was named by the 1607 voyagers, led by Captain Christopher Newport, who first established Jamestown as an English colonial settlement. Since consolidation in 1952, Hampton has included the former Elizabeth City County and the incorporated town of Phoebus, consolidating by mutual agreement.\nAfter the end of the American Civil War, historic Hampton University was established opposite from the town on the Hampton River, providing an education for many newly-freed former slaves and for area Native Americans. In the 20th century, the area became the location of Langley Air Force Base, NASA Langley Research Center, and the Virginia Air and Space Center. Hampton features many miles of waterfront and beaches.\nFor residents and visitors alike, the city features a wide array of business and industrial enterprises, retail and residential areas, and historical sites. Most recently, the new Peninsula Town Center development opened in May 2010 on the site of the former Coliseum Mall. Located in the area adjacent to the Hampton Coliseum and the Convention Center, the new urbanism-type project features a wide mix of retail stores, housing and other attractions. Development of new residential development and additional public facilities (such as the new fishing pier recently opened) are underway at Buckroe Beach, long a noted resort area.\nLocated on the Hampton Roads Beltway, it hosts the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel (HRBT) on Interstate 64. First opened in 1957, it was the world's first bridge-tunnel, crossing the mouth of the Hampton Roads harbor, which serves as the gateway to the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern United States' largest ice-free harbor and its tributary rivers. Expanded in the 1970s, the HRBT remains Virginia's busiest and deepest such facility.\n", "text": "In December 1606, three ships carrying men and boys left England on a mission sponsored by a proprietary company. Headed by Captain Christopher Newport, they sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to North America. After a long voyage, they first landed at the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay on the south shore at a place they named Cape Henry (for Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, the elder son of their king).\nDuring the first few days of exploration, they identified the site of Old Point Comfort (which they originally named \"Point Comfort\") as a strategic defensive location at the entrance to the body of water that became known as Hampton Roads. This is formed by the confluence of the Elizabeth, Nansemond, and James rivers. The latter is the longest river in Virginia.\nWeeks later, on May 14, 1607, they established the first permanent English settlement in the present-day United States about further inland from the Bay which became the site of fortifications during the following 200 years.\nSlightly south, near the entrance to Hampton River, the colonists seized the Native American community of Kecoughtan under Virginia's Governor, Sir Thomas Gates. The colonists established their own small town, with a small Anglican church (known now as St. John's Episcopal Church), on July 9, 1610. This came to be known as part of Hampton. (With Jamestown having been abandoned in 1699, Hampton claims to be the oldest continuously occupied English settlement in the United States). Hampton was named for Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, an important leader of the Virginia Company of London, for whom the Hampton River, Hampton Roads and Southampton County were also named. The area became part of Elizabeth Cittie [sic] in 1619, Elizabeth River Shire in 1634, and was included in Elizabeth City County when it was formed in 1643. By 1680, the settlement was known as Hampton, and it was incorporated as a town in 1705 and became the seat of Elizabeth City County.\nIn the latter part of August 1619, an English ship flying a Dutch flag, the White Lion, appeared off shore from Point Comfort. Its cargo included 20 plus Africans captured from the slave ship Sao Joao Bautista. These were the first Africans to come ashore on English-occupied land in what would become the United States. John Rolfe, the widower of Pocahontas, wrote in a letter that he was at Point Comfort and witnessed the arrival of the first Africans. Although these first Bantu men from Angola were considered indentured servants, their arrival marked the beginning of slavery in North America. Two of the first Africans to arrive at Old Point Comfort in 1619 were Antoney and Isabella. Their child, the first of African descent born in North America, was born baptized January 1624.\nShortly after the War of 1812, the US Army built a more substantial stone facility at Old Point Comfort. It was called Fort Monroe in honor of President James Monroe. The new installation and adjacent Fort Calhoun (on a man-made island across the channel) were completed in 1834.\nFort Monroe, Hampton and the surrounding area played several important roles during the American Civil War (1861\u20131865). Although most of Virginia became part of the Confederate States of America, Fort Monroe remained in Union hands. It became notable as a historic and symbolic site of early freedom for former slaves under the provisions of contraband policies and later the Emancipation Proclamation. After the War, former Confederate President, Jefferson Davis was imprisoned in the area now known as the Casemate Museum on the base.\nTo the south of Fort Monroe, the Town of Hampton had the misfortune to be burned during both the American Revolutionary War and the American Civil War. From the ruins of Hampton left by evacuating Confederates in 1861, \"Contraband\" slaves (formerly owned by Confederates and under a degree of Union protection) built the Grand Contraband Camp, the first self-contained African American community in the United States. A number of modern-day Hampton streets retain their names from that community. The large number of contrabands who sought the refuge of Fort Monroe and the Grand Contraband Camp led to educational efforts which eventually included establishment of Hampton University, site of the famous Emancipation Oak.\nThe original site of the Native American's Kecoughtan Settlement was near the present site of a Hampton Roads Transit facility. To the south of present-day Hampton, a small unrelated incorporated town also named Kecoughtan many years later and also located in Elizabeth City County was annexed by the city of Newport News in 1927. It is now part of that city's East End.\nHampton was incorporated as a city in 1849. On March 30, 1908, Hampton was separated from Elizabeth City County and became an independent city. However, it remained the county seat and continued to share many services with the county. On July 1, 1952, following approval of voters of each locality by referendum, the city of Hampton, the incorporated town of Phoebus and Elizabeth City County merged into the independent city of Hampton. It was the first of a series of political consolidations in the Hampton Roads region during the third quarter of the 20th century.\nFort Monroe is the largest stone fort in the United States. It is now a national park area.\nHampton has a rich and extensive 20th-century military history \u2014 home of Langley Air Force Base, the nation's first military installation dedicated solely to airpower and the home of the U.S. Air Force's 633d Air Base Wing and 1st and 192nd Fighter Wings. Hampton has been a center of military aviation training, research and development for nearly a hundred years, from early prop planes and Zeppelins to rocket parts and advanced fighters. Its proximity to Norfolk means that Hampton has long been home to many Navy families. Together, many Air Force and Navy families in the Hampton area experienced significant losses in war and peacetime due to family members in combat and peacetime military accidents.\nIn particular, during the Vietnam War, Langley Air Force Base was a designated 'waiting base' and thousands of Air Force families were transferred to Hampton from all over the world to wait while their husbands and fathers served in Vietnam. Thousands of Navy families associated with Naval bases in Norfolk next door also waited in Hampton during this era. Vietnam was a very high casualty war for Air Force and Navy pilots (some types of planes experienced a 50% casualty rate), and Naval \"river rats\" who fought on the rivers of the Mekong Delta experienced high casualties as well. There accumulated over time, in the Hampton area, a high concentration of families of unnaccounted for wartime casualties. In many cases Hampton-stationed military families of \"Missing in Action\" or \"Prisoner of War\" pilots and sailors spent many years in the area waiting to find out what had happened to their missing or captured airmen and sailors. The service and, in some cases, sacrifice of these pilots, airmen, sailors and their families, despite not having lifelong connections to the area, are a poignant and inspiring part of Hampton's history.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (62.3%) is water.\nHampton's mild four season climate means outdoor activities can be enjoyed year round. The weather in Hampton is temperate and seasonal. Summers are hot and humid with cool evenings. The mean annual temperature is , with an average annual snowfall of and an average annual rainfall of . No measurable snow fell in 1999. The wettest seasons are the spring and summer, although rainfall is fairly constant all year round. \nAdditionally, the geographic location of the city, with respect to the principal storm tracks, is especially favorable, as it is south of the average path of storms originating in the higher latitudes, and north of the usual tracks of hurricanes and other major tropical storms, with the exception of Hurricane Isabel in 2003.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 137,436 people, 53,887 households, and 35,888 families residing in the city. The population density was 2,828.0 people per square mile (1,091.9/km\u00b2). There were 57,311 housing units at an average density of 1,106.8 per square mile (427.3/km\u00b2).

Other papers include Norfolk's The Virginian-Pilot, Port Folio Weekly, the New Journal and Guide, and the Hampton Roads Business Journal. Hampton Roads Magazine serves as a bi-monthly regional magazine for Hampton and the Hampton Roads area. Hampton Roads Times serves as an online magazine for all the Hampton Roads cities and counties. Hampton is served by a variety of radio stations on the AM and FM dials, with towers located around the Hampton Roads area.\nHampton is also served by several television stations. The Hampton Roads designated market area (DMA) is the 42nd largest in the U.S. with 712,790 homes (0.64% of the total U.S.). The major network television affiliates are WTKR-TV 3 (CBS), WAVY 10 (NBC), WVEC-TV 13 (ABC), WGNT 27 (CW), WTVZ 33 (MyNetworkTV), WVBT 43 (Fox), and WPXV 49 (ION Television). The Public Broadcasting Service station is WHRO-TV 15. Hampton residents also can receive independent stations, such as WSKY broadcasting on channel 4 from the Outer Banks of North Carolina and WGBS-LD broadcasting on channel 11. Hampton is served by Verizon FiOS and Cox Cable.\nHampton is home to the Peninsula Pilots of the Coastal Plain League, a collegiate summer baseball league. The Pilots play at War Memorial Stadium in Hampton. The team began playing in Hampton in the 1980s.\nPublic universities that are outside but near Hampton include Christopher Newport University, Old Dominion University, Norfolk State University, and The College of William and Mary.\nIn the Hampton Roads region, water crossings are a major issue for land-based transportation. The city is fortunate to have a good network of local streets and bridges to cross the various rivers and creeks. Many smaller bridges, especially those along Mercury Boulevard, were named to honor the original NASA astronauts, who had trained extensively at NASA's Langley facilities.\nThe city is located contiguously to the neighboring independent cities of both Newport News and Poquoson. Many roads and streets are available to travel between them. Likewise, Williamsburg, Yorktown and the counties of James City and York are also located nearby in the Peninsula subregion, and many roads lead to them.\nTo reach most of its other neighbors in the South Hampton Roads subregion, it is necessary to cross the harbor and/or the mouth of the James River. There are 3 major motor vehicle crossings. Among these are the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel (HRBT) and the Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel (MMMBT), each forming part of the Hampton Roads Beltway. The HRBT is located on Interstate 64 near downtown Hampton and the MMMBT is a few miles away on Interstate 664 near downtown Newport News. (These two major interstates converge in Hampton near the Hampton Coliseum). The third crossing option is the James River Bridge, also in Newport News, which connects to Isle of Wight County and the town of Smithfield.\nHampton is also served by several major primary and secondary highways. These notably include U.S. Routes 17, 60 and 258, and Virginia State Routes 134 and 143.\nThe Hampton Transit Center, located 2 West Pembroke Boulevard, at the intersection of King Street, close to the downtown area, offers a hub for local and intercity public transportation. It hosts HRT buses, Greyhound/Trailways services and taxicabs.\nHampton Roads Transit (HRT) is the local provider of transit service within the city, as well offering a regional bus system with routes to and from seven other cities in Hampton Roads.\nIntercity bus service is provided by Greyhound Lines and its Carolina Trailways affiliate. The buses serve the Hampton Transit Center. Low cost curbside intercity bus service is also provided by Megabus, with service to Richmond, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Philadelphia.\nHampton is served by several Amtrak trains a day, with direct service from a station in nearby Newport News (on Warwick Boulevard just west of Mercury Boulevard) through Williamsburg and Richmond to points along the Northeast Corridor from Washington DC through Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City all the way to Boston. At Richmond, connections can be made for other Amtrak destinations nationwide.\nHampton is served by two commercial airports. Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport (IATA: PHF) is in Newport News, and Norfolk International Airport (IATA: ORF, ICAO: KORF, FAA LID: ORF) is across the harbor in Norfolk. Both are along portions of Interstate 64.\nThe primary airport for the Virginia Peninsula is the Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport in Newport News. Originally known as Patrick Henry Field (hence its airline code letters \"PHF\"), it was built on the site of Camp Patrick Henry, formerly a World War II facility. It is one of the fastest growing airports in the country, and it reported having served 1,058,839 passengers in 2005. The airport recently added a fourth airline carrier, Frontier Airlines, becoming the first new airline to come to the region in over eight years, despite the economic recession conditions. 2010 was to be the busiest year by passenger count in the airport's history. \nThe larger Norfolk International Airport (often known locally by its code letters \"ORF\") also serves the region. The airport is near the Chesapeake Bay, along the city limits between Norfolk and Virginia Beach. Seven airlines provide nonstop services to 25 destinations. During 2006, ORF had 3,703,664 passengers take off or land at its facility and 68,778,934 pounds of cargo were processed through its facilities.\nThe Chesapeake Regional Airport provides general aviation services. It is in South Hampton Roads in the independent city of Chesapeake.\nHampton has four sister cities:\n- Southampton, England, United Kingdom\n- Vend\u00f4me, Loir-et-Cher, France\n- Pietermaritzburg, South Africa\n- Anyang, Gyeonggi, South Korea\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 5246, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5246, "length": 92, "sectionHeading": "History | Fort Monroe", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5338, "length": 709, "sectionHeading": "History | Modern military history", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6047, "length": 1142, "sectionHeading": "History | Modern military history | Langley AFB during the Vietnam War", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7189, "length": 116, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7305, "length": 748, "sectionHeading": "Geography | Climate", "sectionLabel": "city.climate"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 8053, "length": 1852, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 9905, "length": 1162, "sectionHeading": "Media", "sectionLabel": "city.media"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 11067, "length": 206, "sectionHeading": "Culture | Sports", "sectionLabel": "city.sport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 11273, "length": 182, "sectionHeading": "Colleges and universities", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 11455, "length": 1571, "sectionHeading": "Transportation | Roads and Highways", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 13026, "length": 436, "sectionHeading": "Transportation | Local and regional public transportation", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 13462, "length": 277, "sectionHeading": "Transportation | Intercity bus service", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 13739, "length": 407, "sectionHeading": "Transportation | Amtrak", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 14146, "length": 1491, "sectionHeading": "Transportation | Air", "sectionLabel": "city.environment"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 15637, "length": 168, "sectionHeading": "Sister cities", "sectionLabel": "city.international_affairs"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upton,_Kentucky", "type": "city", "title": "Upton, Kentucky", "abstract": "Upton is a home rule-class city in Hardin and LaRue counties in the U.S. state of Kentucky.

Upton was on the L&N Railroad, one of the key north-south rail roads for the Union. The train station and nearby bridges were attacked during the day on December 26, 1862. The Union forces were quickly defeated and Morgan took advantage of the telegraph station in Upton to gather intelligence on Union troop disposition. Morgan then left Upton to destroy bridges at nearby Bacon Creek in Bonnieville and on the Nolin River.\nUpton is located on the Hardin County/LaRue County line at (37.462175, -85.895335), near the southeast and southwest corners, respectively, of the two counties. U.S. Route 31W passes through the center of the city and follows the county line. The two-lane highway leads north to Sonora and south to Bonnieville. Much of Upton is concentrated around the intersection of US 31W and Kentucky Route 224, which runs westward in the direction of Leitchfield.

The population was 1,557 at the 2010 census. It is located in Greater Houston. After the community was established, it became known as a \"speed trap.\"\n", "text": "A man named H. L. Patton founded the community. Patton Village was developed beginning in the 1960s. Patton remained in control of Patton Village during its development and its incorporation as a municipality in 1966.\nBy 1970 Patton Village reported that it had 667 people. The population steadily increased over a following three decade period. Patton Village became a bedroom community for Houston. In the late 1970s H. L. Patton lost control of the development, due to age. Bruce Nichols of The Dallas Morning News said that \"Several people familiar with the town said troubles began in Patton Village after founding father H.L. Patton [...] lost control.\"\nIn 1985 the city instituted a small property tax. In 1986, after most residents refused to pay the tax, the city repealed it. In 1988 Robert \"Bob\" Devaney, the mayor of Patton Village, said \"Property values are zero. Nobody wants to buy here.\" H. L. Patton died at age 100 in February 1989.\nIn 1989 Bruce Nichols of The Dallas Morning News said that the community \"may be the most squabble-prone small town in Texas. Council meetings regularly become shouting matches. Officials frequently resign or are impeached.\" Nichols pointed to the firing and rehiring of police chief Bruce Nichols and to a town judge, who later was forced to leave his post, who pleaded no contest to clearing a woman's speeding ticket in exchange for solicited sex. In 1988 state prosecutors indicted 76-year-old Floyd Duval, the municipal court judge, for official oppression after soliciting sex from a 21-year-old woman from Splendora as compensation for a traffic ticket fine. Three weeks before Thursday May 26, 1988, the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct suspended Duval's license. On Tuesday May 24, 1988, 36-year-old Lynn Coleman, a lawyer from New Caney and a former Montgomery County assistant attorney, replaced Duval as the municipal court judge. In 1988 a former mayor of Patton Village had been charged with killing his wife and her male companion.\nIn 2008 Pamela Munoz became the mayor of Patton Village after the previous mayor died. On Tuesday October 4, 2011, federal investigators raided Munoz's offices at city hall. A search warrant from Montgomery County said that she had used $1,500 municipal funds to rent large dumpsters that were used at her and her mother's houses. Munoz said that the dumpsters had been placed around the city for municipal purposes, and that the investigators were motivated by racism.\nOn Friday February 24, 2012, Munoz, city secretary Georgia Simons, municipal court clerk Patricia Edmondson, and four municipal police officers were indicted for criminal charges. After a six-month investigation, the Montgomery County District Attorney's office accused them of using police cars, which had been purchased with federal grant money, as collateral to get loans which they used for personal purposes. Due to the arrests, Patton Village city hall closed early that day. After the arrests, the remaining municipal government called for a special session. When city residents found that they were not permitted to address the meeting, many residents walked out before the meeting ended. On Friday, May 10, 2013, Munoz was sentenced to five years in prison.\nAt one point Patton Village had established a \"speed trap\" along what is now Interstate 69/U.S. Highway 59, the main route between Lufkin and Splendora. It became the main source of revenue for the community. The stretch was annexed by the city in 1971. Originally the town was on a two lane road that Steve Weller of the Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel said was a \"road going nowhere\". Therefore, Patton Village did not have much through traffic. The leaders annexed the stretch of US 59, around west of the highway, so it could have through traffic which it could generate revenues from. The through traffic being ticketed did not threaten the actual residents of Patton Village. At one point Patton Village used unmarked police cars with radar equipment in order to catch cars speeding. Bruce Nichols of The Dallas Morning News said in 1988 that the community \"is probably best known for its reputation as a speed trap, which Patton Village leaders say they're trying to overcome.\" When the \"speed trap\" was active, there were 1,100 citations issued by Patton Village authorities per month.\nH. L. Patton had criticized the Patton Village for relying on the speed trap. E. A. Ramsey, the municipal judge, agreed with Patton, saying that the stretch of highway in which the speed trap was located was not in the corporate limits of Patton Village. In December 1981 the Patton Village municipal court refused to prosecute motorists who had been ticketed in that speed trap. This caused severe financial issues in the community; the city did not provide W-2 forms for its municipal employees by the designated deadlines. At one point H. L. Patton had sued the city, accusing then current police chief C. B. \"Bud\" Watson, former town police chief Johnny Naquin, and former police officer Collier Wright of maliciously and willfully confiscating six of Patton's vehicles; the municipal government had been using those six. On the week of February 6, 1982, H. L. Patton had won his suit, and the jury awarded him $12,700 in actual damages and $30,000 in exemplary damages. H. L. Patton announced that he would be willing to forfeit the winnings from the lawsuit pay to rescue the Patton Village municipality from the shortfall.\nIn 1987 a newly passed law limited speeding ticket charges from small towns to $20. According to Texas House of Representatives member Keith Valigura, a Republican of Conroe, said that Patton Village police decided to do roadside inspections with every speeding driver so that the police department could bill drivers for other violations.\nThe newly elected mayor, 66-year-old Robert Devaney, announced on Tuesday May 17, 1988 that he was going to shut down the municipal court that had processed speeding tickets. 90% of Patton Village's revenues had originated from the \"speed traps\" processed by the court and enforced by the then 20-member Patton Village Police Department. The department had continued to maintain a speed trap along U.S. Route 59. Devaney criticized the community for relying on \"speed trap\" revenues and said that his community may give amnesty to drivers with speeding tickets and that it may be able to reduce the police budget since it no longer uses the speed trap. Devaney also requested for an audit and an investigation. Devaney and the Patton Village city council members closed the Patton Village marshal's office; that agency served warrants. Devaney said that after the audit was completed, the marshal's office would reopen with fewer staff members.\nIn 1989 Valigura promoted House Bill 243, which would force municipalities with fewer than 5,000 residents each to only have traffic ticket revenues account for 30% of each municipality budget. Patton Village was in District 16, Valigura's district. In response to the proposed bill, Judy Lennon, the Patton Village mayor, lobbied in an attempt to have the bill blocked. On Wednesday May 10, 1989, the Texas House passed the bill with no opposition. Weller said that \" jealous citizens of nearby Humble, Conroe and Cut and Shoot\" had pressured Texas state legislators into passing the bill. In response, the police chief, David Broussard, engaged in a hunger strike, only taking coffee, water, and a few beers, for 12 days beginning on May 24, 1989. Broussard hoped to cajole Governor of Texas Bill Clements into vetoing the bill. Lloyd Oliver, the city attorney of Patton Village, threatened to legally challenge Valigura's bill in court and said that it \"discriminates against towns under 5,000 population.\" Ultimately Clements signed the bill into law. The pre-Valigura law 1989 Patton Village budget had a projection of $297,700 in total revenues, with 79%, $236,000, to originate from the municipal court issuing citations. Valigura's law took effect on September 1.\nSince then, the Patton Village authorities tried to overhaul the community's image. As of June 1989, police officer vehicles had rooftop lights, and police officers no longer hide in underbrush. From January-October 2016, the city handed out 3,404 tickets and citations, totaling $525,000.\nPatton Village is located at (30.196414, -95.175422).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (6.83%) is water.\nPatton Village is in southeastern Montgomery County, southeast of Conroe and about northeast of Downtown Houston. The town is within the Piney Woods region.\nAs an incorporated city with a population of less than 5000, Patton Village is designated as a general law city under the Constitution of Texas. It is governed at the local level by an elected mayor and five council members. The current mayor is Leah Tarrant. Council member Garry Hershman also serves as mayor pro tem. The other council members are Jonathan Whitworth, David Daniel, Jeanne Reeves, and Clyde Reeves.\nIn the Texas Senate, Patton Village is part of District 4, represented by Republican Brandon Creighton.

The most noteworthy was the Tigard family, headed by Wilson M. Tigard. Arriving in the area known as \"East Butte\" in 1852, the family settled and became involved in organizing and building the East Butte School, a general store (which, starting in 1886, housed the area's post office) and a meeting hall, and renamed East Butte to \"Tigardville\" in 1886. The Evangelical organization built the Emanuel Evangelical Church at the foot of Bull Mountain, south of the Tigard store in 1886. A blacksmith shop was opened in the 1890s by John Gaarde across from the Tigard Store, and in 1896 a new E. Butte school was opened to handle the growth the community was experiencing from an incoming wave of German settlers.\nThe period between 1907 and 1910 marked a rapid acceleration in growth as Main Street blossomed with the construction of several new commercial buildings, Germania Hall (a two-story building featuring a restaurant, grocery store, dance hall, and rooms to rent), a shop/post office, and a livery stable. Limited telephone service began in 1908.\nIn 1910, the arrival of the Oregon Electric Railway triggered the development of Main Street and pushed Tigardville from being merely a small farming community into a period of growth which would lead to its incorporation as a city in 1961. The town was renamed Tigard in 1907 by the railroad to greater distinguish it from the nearby Wilsonville, and the focus of the town reoriented northeast towards the new rail stop as growth accelerated.\n1911 marked the introduction of electricity, as the Tualatin Valley Electric company joined Tigard to a service grid with Sherwood and Tualatin. William Ariss built a blacksmith shop on Main Street in 1912 that eventually evolved into a modern service station. In the 1930s the streets and walks of Main Street were finally paved, and another school established to accommodate growth.\nThe city was the respondent in (and eventual loser of) the landmark property rights case, Dolan v. City of Tigard, decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1994. The case established the \"rough proportionality\" test that is now applied throughout the United States when a local government evaluates a land use application and determines the exactions to require of the recipient of a land use approval.\nIn the 2004 general elections, the city of Tigard won approval from its voters to annex the unincorporated suburbs on Bull Mountain, a hill to the west of Tigard.

Often referred to as the \"Heart of the San Ramon Valley,\" Danville was first populated by Native Americans who lived next to the creeks and camped on Mount Diablo in the summer. Later it was part of Mission San Jose's grazing land and a Mexican land grant called Rancho San Ramon.\nInitially a farming community, the Town of Danville switched from wheat to fruits and nuts after the Southern Pacific Railroad built a spur line through the area in 1891. It developed as a residential suburb starting in 1947 when the first sizable housing tracts were constructed and its population boomed in the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe Danville Post Office opened in 1860 with hotel owner Henry W. Harris as the first postmaster. Harris reported in 1862 that there were 20 people living in the town proper, with 200 ballots cast in the last general election. Hearing stories of the prosperity to be found in California, people from the mid-west and east began to settle in Danville and the surrounding valleys. Most new residents had been farmers and observed that the valley land was fertile and the weather benign, altogether an ideal place to settle. The 1869 census counted nearly 1800 people in the combined Danville and Lafayette areas. They squatted or purchased land from the Mexican and other owners and established ranches, farms and businesses.\nSettlers raised cattle and sheep and grew wheat, barley and onions. Later the farms produced hay, a wide variety of fruit crops (apples, plums, pears), walnuts and almonds. In the 1800s horses and wagons hauled these products north to the docks at Pacheco and Martinez, following Road No. 2, which wound by San Ramon Creek and was almost impassable in the rainy season.\nChurches, schools, farmers unions and fraternal lodges began as the community evolved. The Union Academy, a private high school begun by the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, served the County from 1859 to 1868 when it burned down. The Danville Presbyterian Church was dedicated in 1875, following a vote of Protestants regarding what denomination it should be. The new building was described as the handsomest church building in the County by the writers of the day.\nIn 1873, Danville Grange No. 85 was chartered with Charles Wood elected as the first Worthy Master. The Grange began as a family farmers union and included all the Valley \"movers and shakers.\" It served as the focal point for community social, educational and political activity for years and still meets at its Hall on Diablo Road.\nA remarkable number of early Danville buildings remain today such as the houses belonging to the Boone, Osborn, Young, Spilker, Podva, Vecki, Root, Elliott and Hartz families. The original 1874 Grange Hall exists as well, and the original Danville Hotel remains downtown and is currently being renovated as of 2014. Many of the early pioneer names appear on the streets and schools, including Baldwin, Harlan, Wood, Love, Hemme, Boone, Bettencourt and Meese.\nWhen the Southern Pacific Railroad came to the Valley in 1891, Danville changed dramatically. The farmers built warehouses and shipped crops by rail in any kind of weather, and the residents traveled to and from Danville with an ease they had not experienced before.\nJohn Hartz sold of his land for the Danville Depot and granted land access to the station. He then subdivided and sold lots east of the station, shifting the town's focus from Front Street to Hartz Avenue. Eventually, a bank, drug store, saloon, doctor's office and Chinese laundry joined the houses lining the street. The Danville Hotel originally sat across from the station and was moved to face Hartz avenue in 1927.\nThe twentieth century found Danville affected by the wars, the Spanish flu, the depression and new immigrants. The Valley became a melting pot of Chinese, Portuguese, German, and Japanese immigrants. They often began working in the hay fields or as cooks and gardeners, later becoming blacksmiths, landowners, teachers and storekeepers.\nResidents worked diligently to improve their community. In 1910 a public high school district was organized and San Ramon Valley Union High School was built; a library supervised by Lillian Close opened in 1913 with 104 books; St. Isidore's Catholic Church was first established at Hartz and Linda Mesa in 1910; and an Improvement League spearheaded the first streetlights and paved roads in 1915.\nDanville continued to be farm country well into the 1940s. The whole Valley had 2,120 people in 1940, growing to 4,630 by 1950. Developments such as Montair and Cameo Acres were built, the water and sewer districts extended their boundaries, and the new I-680 freeway which sliced through Danville in the mid-1960s altered Danville permanently.\nThe Valley population leaped from 12,700 in 1960 to 15,900 in 1970, to 21,100 in 1975 to 26,500 in 1980. The 1980 census showed that 82 percent of Danville's 26,500 had arrived after 1970. In 2000, Danville's population reached 40,484. Many newly successful individuals particularly from the booming Silicon Valley looked to San Ramon Valley as a safe area with great schools, leading to a large increase of Danville residents.\nIn 1982, Danville citizens voted to incorporate their community.\nAdjoining towns and cities are San Ramon to the south, Diablo, and Alamo to the north. Walnut Creek is north, while Pleasanton is about south.\nInterstate 680 serves as the main means of transport out of the town.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.\nDanville is set in a narrow section of the San Ramon Valley with the Las Trampas Ridge to the west and the Diablo Range to the east. The most prominent landmark of Danville is the backdrop of Mount Diablo, which stands to the east at and provides a picturesque backdrop for Danville and neighboring towns and cities. Sycamore Creek drains some of the Mount Diablo slopes and flows through Danville.\nExtreme temperatures range from 115 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C), recorded in 1950, to 18 \u00b0F (-8 \u00b0C), recorded in 1990.\nAccording to Business Insider, Danville's 94506 is the 14th wealthiest zip code in America.

Majority of the downtown area is occupied by Poblacion Ilawod. Dorillo Street divides the whole city proper area into two barangays; the western portion occupied by Poblacion Ilaya, and the eastern part occupied by Poblacion Ilawod. Barangay Poblacion Ilawod was the political center of Passi when it was a municipality; however, the new city hall and the government center were transferred to Brgy. Sablogon when Passi was proclaimed as a city in 1998.\nThe City of Passi belongs to the 4th District of Iloilo.\nListed below are the respective population of each barangay as of 2010.\nAlthough its young distinction as a city, Passi is considered to be one of the oldest Spanish settlements in Iloilo. It was organized as a pueblo (community settlement of natives) in 1766 with Don Martin Saligumba as its first leader. But the place has actually been settled by three Malay brothers named Dig-on, Tokiab and Umawang long before the arrival of the Spaniards. Their first formal community was located on the site presently occupied by the Roman Catholic Church.\nAccording to popular legend, Spanish conquistadors stumbled on a small hut by the river\u2019s bank where an old woman was fond winnowing pounded rice. One of them asked her, \u201c\u00bfC\u00f3mo se llama este lugar?\u201d not knowing the native language of course. Much to the old woman\u2019s surprise and perhaps excitement, she replied without much ado, \u201cAh, pasi,\u201d which means some of the unhusked rice on her basket. She must have thought that they were eager to know what was in the basket and what she was doing, because she could not understand their language. From that time on, the Spanish begun to call the place Pasi at first until it later evolved into Passi. Such legends about name origins are common throughout towns and cities in the Philippines, the core plot being a Spaniard asking the non-Spanish speaking natives what the name of the place is and the latter responding in what would end up eventually as the name of the place.\nIt is said that the first Spanish settlement was established in the area in 1766, marking the onset of Spanish colonial rule. In the traditional story, Spanish explorers anchored in Ansig, a place located at the mouth of Lamunan River. The founding of the present poblacion of Passi was attributed to Don Martin Saligumba. His notable title \u201cDon\u201d indicated his leadership and power over the group.\nIn 1957, the sitio of Agtabo in the barrio of Salngan was converted into a barrio. In the same year the barrio of Santa Rosa was renamed Santo Tomas.\nPassi then became progressive and had experience tremendous development over the period. Because of its strategic location, Passi became a center for trade and commerce bringing more investment opportunities to the municipality. Its high income, high population growth, and a big area of land has finally bring into the limelight and recognized as the first component city in the Island of Panay. After a hard-earned endeavor, its conversion as a city was made through the signing of R.A. 8469 on the 30th day of January, 1998 by the then President of the Philippines, Pres. Fidel V. Ramos.\nThe natives of this city are called Passinhons, with most people speaking Kinaray-a, together with other surrounding towns. People also speak Hiligaynon, Capiznon, Tagalog and English as second languages.\nKinaray-a is the most dominant language spoken in Passi City. English is used as the language of business and education. In addition, other local dialects such as Hiligaynon is also spoken. Some Spanish words are used accompanying the Kinaray-a conversation, which is very evident among the elderly and some wealthy families and also the elder members of the micro-community of sugar-plantations related families.\nThe Passinhon people are predominantly Roman Catholic. Protestant churches also exist such as members of Philippine Independent Church or Aglipayan Church, Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, Adventist, and other Evangelical Christians; There are also non Protestant and other Christian sects such as Iglesia Ni Cristo, Church of Christ of Latter day Saints (Mormon) and Jehovah's Witnesses.\nThe physical resources of Passi consists of relatively good soil types along rolling hills and narrow valley plains with substantial surface and ground water, with no distinct dry and wet season which is suitable for a wide range of agricultural products like rice, sugarcane, and pineapple. When the sugar industry experience a slump due to falling sugar prices and quotas in the world market, farmers diversified into other agricultural products like corn, pineapple, mongo, root crops, and other farm- based products. The City has investment potentials for Agri-Industrial developments.\nPassi is a 4th class component city with this year\u2019s annual income of P300,860,719-General Income, P26,732,922-Special Educational Fund, P37,287,853-Trust Fund, with a total current operating income of P364,881,424 .\nPassi City has played an important role in reaching its peak of progress.

This festival is perhaps one of the best known and established festivals of the Visayan region that have evolved through the years. It has played a big part in the lives of most Passinhons. It is the most popular spectator cultural event and the most popular for the community that has a large following. Theatrical-like street dancing performances are a celebrated part of the Pintados festivity that is characterized by heavy and aggressive body movements. Here, performers adorned in traditional body tattoo with elaborate geometrical designs in their body, including their arms, legs and torso dramatizes stories in which the towns\u2019 ancestral beings laid down every feature of the area, especially, their way of life.\nCharacterized by heavy and aggressive body movements, the dances seem to have developed independent of any external influences, as in the combat dances, folk plays, ritual actions, or character types. Historical or cultural sources are essential materials in sustaining a festival such as theirs. The festivity changed over the years, though its cultural presentation remained popular up to this day, and has resurrected and form part in a celebration that reflected function and transition. It also represented a major change in style and subject matter.\nPanay Island has a very rich cultural heritage. Dubbed as the cradle of civilization, its glorious past is diverse. Its fertile folklore has become the envy of other cultures that many have wanted to disprove them but to no avail.\nThe Island pride itself of the epic of Hinilawod and the story of ten Bornean datus. Its imposing landscape is a good mind of narratives that were passed on from generation to generation and have been preserved in the hearts of its people.\nThe first inhabitants of the Island called it Aninipay, after the name of the plant that was then abundant in the area. When the Malayans came, they named it Madia-as, which was the name of the highest peak in the Island.\nThe name Panay was given only after the Spaniards came to the Island. When Miguel Lopez de Legaspi settled in Cebu, he was faced with a problem of food storage. Hidden sent his men to scour the surrounding Island for food and one of the boats reached Madia-as. Having found plenty of food in the place, the crew returned to Cebu and reported the news to Legaspi who exclaimed in thanksgiving \u201cPan hay in este isla\" (\u201cThere is food on this island!\u201d). The first two words eventually identified the island.\nBut unknown to many, the first batch of Spaniards that reached the island gave a different name to it. They called it \u201cIsla de Pintados\u201d after seeing tattooed men whom they called pintados or \u201cpainted people.\u201d\nThe art tattooing was practiced all throughout the island. The chronicler Miguel de Loarca, in his account in Historia Pre-Hispanica de Filipinas Sobre la Isla de Panay, described the pintado practice, thus: \u201cThe mean tattoo intire bodies with beautiful figures using small pieces of iron dipped in ink. This ink incorporate itself into the blood and the marks are indelible.\u201d\nCulturally, the inhabitants of Panay used tattoos to exhibit their record in battle. The more tattoo marks a man had on his body, the higher his status as a warrior. The elegance of the pintado practice has raised tattooing into the level of art. They do then with such order, symmetry, and coordination that they elicit admiration from those who see them.\nWhile the men put tattoo all over their body, it was a rule in the old Panay society that women only wear tattoos on one side of their arms.\nAccording to one account, while a group of Spaniards who had settled in Calinog went downstream of the Jalaur River and anchored in a place called Ansig, they saw a tattooed woman who was winnowing pounded palay. One of them asked her what the name of the place is. The woman, who did not understand Spanish, thought that the man was asking what she was doing and replied \u201cnaga-pangpasi\u201d which means peaking out unhusked rice from pounded palay. From then on, the Spaniards called the place \u201cPasi\u201d which later involved into \u201cPassi\u201d. As the Spaniards begun to Christianize the inhabitants of Panay, the friars believed the tattooing was a pagan practice and forced the natives to abandon the art, thus resulting to the disappearance of the pintado culture.\nHowever, the practice did not escape the eyes of historians who recorded it with respect and veneration that this form of art deserve. For many, it was a practice that ought not only to be preserved but also to be revived in some other ways to highlight the fact that during the pre-Spanish era, an advanced civilization of artistic people had already flourished in this part of the archipelago. It is in this context that Passi, one of the earliest Malayan settlement in the island, embarks on this project to showcase and revive one of Panay\u2019s rich cultural legacies from its ancestors.\nImageTourism, through this cultural celebration brings thousands of local and international visitors interested to know the city\u2019s rich history, considerable scenic beauty, and a number tourism attraction. The Passinhon 2000 Incorporated devotes their efforts of promoting the festival in the local and national scene. These efforts focus on the cultural festivity\u2014at least in the early promotional stage, is the best way to keep it alive, and a variety of innovative efforts are underway to do just that.\nAside from having its own festival, Passi City also joins as a competing tribe at the Kasadyahan during Iloilo Dinagyang Festival. Last 2005, Pintados de Pasi was hailed as champion during the said event. The said tribe represented the Iloilo Province during the 2005 Aliwan Festival in Manila. Again, Passi was hailed as the overall champion. After garnering those awards, the city announced that they will no longer join as a competing tribe during Dinagyang and that they will become a fully independent festival. The year, 2008 marks the 10th Foundation Anniversary.\nPinta Lawas (body painting) as well as carabao (water buffalo) painting contests are being practiced followed by Karosa Parada (carriage parade that is drawn by a painted carabao) Binibining Pintados (1998-2016), Mr. Passi (a new pageant starting 2017 that replaces Binibining Pintados), a boat and bicycle racing events, Sinadya sa Suba (fun in the river) and a tribal dancing competition.\nChristmas in the City is held every middle of December until the first Sunday of January in the next year at Plaza Paloma. During its opening day it had a grand fireworks display, followed by the opening of lights, and food stalls. Trees and other structures in the plaza are designed with colorful lights. Lamp post are also illuminated with designs. It is a must visit for food enthusiast as lechon, liempo, inasal na manok and other meat barbecue are served at the food stalls. Drinks are also served. Food stalls for children are also available like popcorn, cotton candy, pancakes, and others. Every night there are presentations held at the middle of the plaza by different institutions or probably a live band playing to add entertainment to already lively environment.\nPassi City celebrates the feast of its patron saint, San Guillermo de Ermita (St. William the Hermit) on the 10th of February along with the coronation of the fiesta queen. Mostly the activities are already starting 1 week before. There will be street parades in the morning. Programs are held every night in the plaza sponsored by different institutions and there will be dancing afterwards. Carnivals and rides in the plaza are available for the public and small store kiosk are open to sell different items like clothing, jewelry, home designs, etc. It is one of the most anticipated festival in the city.\nThis is considered a militaristic church in that it was planned as a \u2018fortress church\u2019 and the proof of this can be seen in the massive buttresses which support the front and back walls of the church. The church was built to replace churches that had been destroyed by an earthquake in 1612 and subsequent churches that had been destroyed by fires.\nIn 1856 Friar Pedro Ceberio restored the church that had fallen into disrepair and what we see today is the result of his work.\nAs is usual in churches of this vintage that can immediately discern that it was built, once again, by the Augustinians since their seal appears in the archway over one of the side entrances. It is said that the historical record is vague on the topic of entrances that indicates that historians are not certain as to where the actual main entrance was placed by the original builders. It appears that it may well have been this doorway on the southeast corner of the church at the entrance of the \u2018Garden of Saints\u2019.\nAll was well with the church through the Revolution and the Philippines American War but in 1932 the roof was blown away by a typhoon.\nThe church is surrounded by a \u2018Garden of the Saints\u2019 which contains 25 to 30 statues of Saints that have been placed in the garden by parishioners over the years.\nPerhaps the most striking feature of the entire church is the sanctuary, which when is light up is both dramatically breathtaking and simply beautiful.\nInside the very tall belfry of the church are the three bells, two of which are massive ones and the other one is a small one. To ring the large one, they need to step on the chain that is attached to the bell\u2019s clapper to make it hit the sound rim. The harder it is stepped on it the louder would the sound be. The two other bells are rung manually. They have to hold the two clappers together and hit them to the sound rim to make them work. This makes the bell ringer so close to the bells when ringing them.\nThe discovery of Passi, at the same time its foundation as a mission parish by the Spanish explorers for Panay Island occurred in 1584. It was placed under the patronage of St. William whose feast had since then been celebrated every February 10. In 1593, Padre Juan Villamayor, an Augustinian friar, became its first resident priest.\nThe first mission church was made out of light materials and located near the riverbank of Jalaur River. In 1600 the church was transferred from the old site to its present location. The foundation and the walls were made of stones, slabs and lime. The parishioners were made to carry the needed materials every time they went to the church. The construction was finished during the time of Padre Pedro Ceberio when Salvador \u201cBadong\u201d Panes Perfecto was the Captain of the town.\n- Schism and Abaca\nAround 1821 during the time of Padre Apolinario Villanueva, Schism ensued between him as Parish Priest and the Spanish Populace of the town. He transferred the seat of the Parish Church to Abaca where he constructed a chapel. When Padre Martin succeeded him, the seat of the parish church was returned to Passi.\n- Aglipayon Revolution\nWith the concurring Filipino Revolution against the Spanish government, there was a clamor of the Filipino Clergy for reforms. Padre Rafael Murillo, the Parish Priest then was a good follower and supporter of the Aglipay. He was elevated to the rank of an Aglipayan Bishop not long brought with him his family. To support his family, he demanded tributes from the people. The Passinhons under Captain Badong Perfecto strongly objected and Padre Joaquin was removed not long after.\nPadre Lorenzo Diaz, a Catholic Augustinian Priest administered the Parish. The year 1891 saw the last Spanish Augustinian Parish Priest of Passi in Padre Bravo.\n- Reverend Father Amado Panes Perfecto\nIn 1893, after three centuries of Christianization, Passi was able to produce its first priest, Padre Amado Panes Perfecto. He studied in the University of Salamanca in Spain and graduated a Doctor of Canon Law, which at that time was a rare privilege. He was appointed the first Filipino Priest of Passi. He constructed the most beautiful convent in the Diocese furnished with carved furniture and imported chinaware and utensils. One of his remaining masterpieces is the \u201cFlores de Mayo Salve\u201d which has become part of the tradition of the town.\n- World War II\nWorld War II was conflagration for the Passinhons. Fire gluttered all the Spanish built houses of the town. The guerillas burned all the buildings leaving the town empty for the occupying Japanese. Nothing was left of the wooden structure of both church and convent but the stones. The church was made the garrison of the Japanese forces and later the headquarters of the Residence Civil Government. Filipino troops under the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary were liberated in Passi and help the local guerrilla groups by attacking Japanese troops and ended in World War II.\n- Lady Caycay earthquake\nThe 1948 Lady Caycay earthquake occurred on January 25, 1948 at 1:46 AM in Panay Island, Philippines. The bell tower did not survive the harshness of the earthquake. The tall tower was wrecked; making the entire bells fell down to the ground. No damage was found except for the other massive bell, which had a very slight crack on it.\nThe reconstruction of the church took a gradual development. The wood and nipa roofing of the church was constructed during the time of Padre Parre\u00f1as. Wooden posts were placed at the Eastern side of the church as temporary area to place the bells, since the bell tower was damaged during the 1948 earthquake. When Padre Buenaflor took over, he had the roof changed into galvanized iron. The improvement of the altar which was transferred by Padre Parre\u00f1as to the main entrance of the church was done during the time of Padre Casta\u00f1o. The present church with its steel trusses, washed walls, benches, and a new but permanent belfry, together with the old parish convent already demolished, the Assumption School and the former Social Hall, were all constructed as projects of Msgr. Eligio Villavert, the 81st Parish Priest of Passi.\nIt was 1997 when the Parish of St. William was graced with another Passinhon Priest. Msgr. Felipe Dativo Palomo, P.C., fully supported by the Parish Councils and the Passinhon Parishioners both local and abroad decided to venture into ambitious but necessary projects. In the year 2000, the completion and the blessing of the Jubilee Hall, the largest and tallest parish convent in the whole Diocese was witnessed.\n After the completion, behind the church, the attention of the parishioners and Msgr. Palomo were directed to the uncompleted church. The main entrance is nowhere to be found, making Passi Church one of its kind. The landscaping of the Western side of the church and the installation of the statues of the saints took place.\nThe altar was transferred to its original place, to give way to the restoration of its original main entrance. The altar has been beautifully restored according to the Augustinian\u2019s original architectural design. The ornate granite flooring, echo-proof ceiling, decorative stained glasses, a huge steel door at the main entrance and modern lighting facilities were installed. On the Eastern side, one can see the Avenida de la Virgin Maria, the Adoration Chapel, parking area, and the very huge relief map of Passi City.\nIn October 26, 2010, the Church of St. William the Hermit had its Solemn Dedication, an annual festivity which the Parishioners will celebrate to continue recalling the extra graciousness God has abundantly bestowed in the Christian Community of Passi.\n- Typhoon Yolanda\nOn November 8, 2013, signal number four Typhoon Yolanda (also known internationally as Typhoon Haiyan) hit the Visayas Region, causing serious damages to the infrastructure, including the church. The church, three years after it is restored was partially damaged. The ceiling outside the church and into the altar collapsed. The church was temporarily closed and masses are temporarily held at the Jubilee Hall. However, it was opened again to the public on December 16, 2013 after the massive reconstruction and repair.\nPassi City has several landmarks that symbolizes its rich history and culture over the years.

Since local facilities were inadequate to treat the victims, the citizens of Hickory and the March of Dimes decided to build a hospital to care for the children of the region. From the time the decision was made until equipment, doctors, and patients were in a new facility, took less than 54 hours. Several more buildings were quickly added. A Red Cross official on the scene praised the project \"as the most outstanding example of cooperative effort he has ever seen.\"\nThe city also came to national attention when the remains of Zahra Baker were found leading to a police investigation where Zahra's stepmother, Elise Baker, was found guilty of second-degree murder.

Two battles for the control of the Weldon Railroad were fought near Petersburg during the Siege of Petersburg in June 1864 and September 1864. On December 7, 1864, 28,000 Union troops led by Major General Gouverneur K. Warren tried to sever that key supply route further south by uprooting tracks, and managed to stop Confederate troops under Major General Wade Hampton from destroying the Meherrin river bridge. However, when they retreated, Confederates rebuilt the railway line. After the war, the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad was leased to the Wilmington, Columbia and Augusta Railroad, which went bankrupt in 1878.\nGreensville County native and delegate Benjamin D. Tillar Jr. (1855-1887) received a charter for the Atlantic and Danville Railway, which he planned would go from Portsmouth as had the Weldon railroad, but more westward through the Meherrin river towns. In 1887, Hicksford and Belfield merged, forming the new incorporated town of Emporia, which was named after the town of Emporia, Kansas, home town of Tillar's friend U.S. Senator Preston B. Plumb of Kansas. However, the railroad boom proved short-lived, as poor farm conditions and the Panic of 1893 caused the county's population to decrease between 1880 and 1890. The Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad also ran through Emporia.\nEmporia was re-chartered in 1892, and the town issued its first bonds (to establish a water plant, lighting and street improvements) in 1900. It hosted an agricultural fair in 1906, and brick buildings replaced frame structures. Banks were chartered, followed by land improvement companies and insurance companies, then various stores, automobile companies and cola bottlers.\nThe Virginia General Assembly re-chartered the Town of Emporia as an independent city in 1967, five years after the Norfolk and Western Railway purchased and reorganized the Atlantic and Danville Railway. Now, a major north-south CSX railway line crosses a Norfolk Southern east-west line in Emporia. Also, U.S. Route 58 cross Emporia east-west and Interstate 95 and U.S. Route 301 cross north-south, so providing services for travelers continues important in modern Emporia. \nHistoric buildings in Emporia include the Belfield-Emporia Historic District, Hicksford-Emporia Historic District, Greensville County Courthouse Complex, Greensville County Training School, H. T. Klugel Architectural Sheet Metal Work Building, Old Merchants and Farmers Bank Building, and Village View, all of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nEmporia is located at (36.693018, -77.53809).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (1.1%) is water.

Victoria is the cathedral city of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Victoria in Texas.\n", "text": " The city of Guadalupe Victoria was founded in 1824 by Mart\u00edn De Le\u00f3n, a Mexican empresario, in honor of Guadalupe Victoria, the first President of the Republic of Mexico. Victoria was initially part of De Le\u00f3n's Colony, which had been founded that same year. By 1834, the town had a population of approximately 300.\nDuring the Texas Revolution, Guadalupe Victoria contributed soldiers and supplies to pro-revolutionary forces. However, after James Fannin was defeated by the Mexican army at the Battle of Coleto, the town was occupied by Mexican forces. After Santa Anna was defeated at the Battle of San Jacinto, the town's Mexican residents were driven out by Anglo settlers, who renamed it Victoria.\nIn 1840, a Comanche raid on nearby Linnville killed many residents of the town. A cholera outbreak occurred in 1846.\nDuring the mid-19th century, the city developed a large population of European immigrants, particularly Germans.

The United States Congress passed the Indian Removal Act in 1830, and forced most of the Southeastern tribes to Indian Territory during the following decade.\nGreenville was founded in 1824 by William W. Blanton, who filed for land from the United States government. He was granted section four, township eighteen, range eight west. This plot now constitutes most of downtown Greenville.\nGreenville became the county seat in 1844. The two previous county seats, New Mexico and Princeton, had both caved into the Mississippi River.\nThe current city of Greenville is the third in the State to bear the name. The first, located to the south near Natchez, became defunct soon after the American Revolution as European-American settlement was concentrated to the east.\nThe second is the parent city to the present one and was settled in the early 19th century. It was named by its founders for General Nathanael Greene, beloved friend of George Washington, for whom the county was named. This Greenville was located three miles from the present site. Today it is the site of the city\u2019s industrial fill. The second town was a thriving hamlet in the days before the Civil War. As county seat, it was the trading, business, and cultural center for the large cotton plantations that surrounded it. Most plantations were located directly on the Mississippi and other major navigable tributaries. The interior bottomlands were not developed until after the war.\nThe town was destroyed during the Union Army's actions related to the siege of Vicksburg. Troops from a Union gunboat landed at Greenville. In retaliation for being fired upon, they burned every building. The inhabitants took refuge in plantation homes of the area. When the war ended, veterans of Mississippi regiments found Greenville in a state of ruin. The former residents soon decided to build again. The place chosen was the highest point on the Mississippi River between the towns of Vicksburg and Memphis. Much of the land then belonged to the Roach and Blanton families; the major part of the area selected was on property owned by Mrs. Harriet Blanton Theobald. She welcomed the idea of a new Greenville, donating land for schools, churches and public buildings. She was called the \"Mother of Greenville\".

This culture was particularly prominent from 13th to the 15th centuries, long before European exploration. Earthwork mounds were built by peoples in this area from the 9th century. The people in this region were influenced by the larger Mississippian culture, which built similar ceremonial sites throughout the Mississippi Valley and its tributaries. The historic Natchez people are considered the only contemporary surviving group of the Mississippian culture at the time of European exploration.\nThe Winterville Mounds has been designated as a state park and National Historic Landmark. A museum on the grounds displays artifacts recovered in professional excavations and adds to the interpretation of this complex, and the park has walking trails.

They called the area Ahapopka. Aha, meaning \"Potato,\" and papka, meaning \"eating place\". By the 1830s, this settlement numbered about 200, and was the birthplace of the chief Coacoochee (known in English as \"Wild Cat\").\nAt the conclusion of the Second Seminole War, the U.S. Congress passed the Armed Occupation Act of 1842, forcing surviving natives at Ahapopka to abandon their village and seek refuge deeper in the wilderness of the Florida peninsula.\nThe early American settlers built a major trading center on the foundations of the earlier Indian settlement.

He was tried in the east room of the log house before Squire Pate for operating a ferry across the Ohio River without a license, but the justice of the peace dismissed the case against him. The house is now a county landmark and is open for tours throughout the year.\nDuring the Civil War, Bill Davison and Isaac Coulter captured and robbed the steamship Morning Star here on December 23, 1864, killing three Union soldiers. The town's only bank was shuttered during the Great Depression. Upon its founding in 1938, the Lewisport School System comprised eight local one-room schools; today it is part of the Hancock County Consolidated School System.\nLewisport is located in northwestern Hancock County at (37.935023, -86.905270), on the south bank of the Ohio River. The closest river crossings are by road to the east, at Hawesville, and the same distance to the west, at U.S. Route 231 near Rockport, Indiana. U.S. Route 60 passes east-west through the southern end of Lewisport. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 1,639 people, 648 households, and 452 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,540.8 people per square mile (597.0/km\u00b2). There were 748 housing units at an average density of 703.2 per square mile (272.5/km\u00b2).

It is in the Carpathian Mountains, in the Do\u0142y Jasielsko-Sanockie, by the Ropa River. Due to its rich history, it is often referred to as \"little Krak\u00f3w\" or the \"pearl of the Carpathians.\" The many preserved medieval city walls and buildings have also given rise to the nickname \"Polish Carcassonne.\" \nBy the mid-16th century, the city was one of the largest in Poland. Being a royal city, Biecz enjoyed an economic and social Renaissance during the 14th and 15th centuries which tapered off into a gradual decline starting during the 17th century. Today, it is a small, picturesque tourist town with numerous historical monuments.\n", "text": "The earliest mentions in historical sources give the name of the town as Beyech, Begech, Begecz, Begesz, Beyecz, Beecz, Beycz, Byecz and Beiech. This allows to establish that the original form of the name was Biejecz, apparently a regular possessive adjective derived from the diminutive personal name Biejek (not attested, but easily reconstructable from Biejecz and perhaps Biejk\u00f3w). The age of the town makes further derivation from Bieniedzikt improbable, leading linguists to hypothesize that the ultimate source is Biezdziad or some other Slavic name beginning in Bie-. (Among many other Slavic towns whose names were created with -j\u044c suffix are e.g. Cracow and Yaroslavl). Later, in the 13th century, the nominative stem was levelled to the oblique stem Biejcz- (e.g. Loc. w Biejczu \"in Biejecz\"), giving Biejcz without stem alternations (attested as late as the 17th century) and then the current form, Biecz.\nApart from that, there are a plethora of other theories, including obvious folk etymologies, linking the name e.g. to a Carpathian tribe called Biessi, mentioned by Ptolemy; a legendary bandit called Becz; the Beskids; and a west and south-west Slavic dialectal word meaning \"borough\", attested e.g. as Be\u010d/\u0411\u0435\u0447 in Serbo-Croatian, borrowed into Romani (Bech) and Hungarian (B\u00e9cs).\nThe Biecz coat of arms depicts Saints Peter and Paul on a field of red. St. Paul, on the right, holds a sword, while St. Peter holds the Keys of Heaven. Between them is the capital letter B, a reference to the city name.\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 16th century, when official seals depicting the images of Saints Peter and Paul and the letter B first appeared. The seals were used with more regularity during the 17th and 18th centuries. On 12 July 1990, the Municipal Council officially adopted the use of the coat of arms in Resolution No. III/15/90.\nBiecz lies on the Ropa River, on a pass through the Carpathian Mountains. Up until the 19th century, the River ran through the heart of the city. With the construction of the railroad, however, the river's course was altered so that it ran alongside the city instead.\nDespite the relatively small size of the city, there is a significant grade in elevation. The highest point lies at above sea level, while the lowest lies at . Biecz borders Binarowa, G\u0142\u0119boka, Grudna K\u0119pska, Korczyna, Libusza, and Strzeszyn.\nIn the Biecz and the surrounding area there are a number of oil deposits.\nBiecz lies in the South-eastern part of Poland, approximately from the Slovakian border and from the Ukrainian border. The distance from Biecz to the most important Polish cities is: Nowy S\u0105cz - , Tarn\u00f3w - , Krak\u00f3w - , Katowice - , Lublin - , \u0141\u00f3d\u017a - , Warsaw - , Pozna\u0144 - , Bydgoszcz - , Gda\u0144sk - , and Szczecin - .\nThe city lies within the borders of the historical region of Ma\u0142opolska. Throughout history, the territory was also a part of the region of Krak\u00f3w. Biecz's importance during his medieval and renaissance heyday resulted in the city receiving administrative control over a significant amount of surrounding territory (Latin: Terra Biecensis).\nThe average annual temperature is approximately . The average high in July is , and in January the average low is . The area receives at most of rain per annum. Sheet ice in winter lasts approximately 100 days, and has an average thickness of .\nBiecz municipality is split into three formal divisions called jednostki pomocnicze gminy (literally, auxiliary municipality units). These divisions are numbered one through three. Each division has a governing council, with an elected chairman. As of 2007, the chairmen of the divisions were: W\u0142adys\u0142aw Lignar, Renata Kud\u0142a, and Ireneusz Zaj\u0105c.\nIn addition to the formal divisions, Biecz has a number of neighborhoods, each with their own particular history and character. These include:\n1. Miasto: old parts of town enclosed by the remains of the city walls.\n2. Podwale: historical buildings that abut the remains of the city walls. The name literally means \"under the walls.\"\n3. Za\u0142awie: part of town on the embankments of the Ropa River. The neighborhood abuts the village of Korczyna\n4. Belna Dolna: part of town along the banks of the Ropa within district 2.\n5. Belna G\u00f3rna: area encompassed by district number 2, along ulica Belna G\u00f3rna.\n6. Przedmie\u015bcie Dolne: Settlement along ulica Przedmie\u015bcie Dolne and partly along Casimir the Great Street.\n7. Kurpiel: also called Przedmie\u015bcie G\u00f3rne, part of town along ulica Przedmie\u015bcie G\u00f3rne.\n8. Osiedle G\u00f3rne: settlement along the streets ulica Tysi\u0105clecia, ulica Sk\u0142odowska, ulica kr\u00f3lowa Jadwiga, and ulica S\u0142oneczny.\n9. N\u0119ck\u00f3wka: settlement past Osiedle G\u00f3rne. It is sparsely populated, and mostly consists of forests, orchards, and cultivated fields.\n10. Wapniska: part of town along the top of ulica ks. Jan Bochniewicz\n11. Harta: part of town along ulica Harta.\nThe area of Biecz has been settled periodically since the Neolithic period, though the first mentions of a named settlement date back to the 11th century. This early medieval town was approximately from the modern one. By the 12th century, the town had become a castellany, and by the mid-14th century, it had been granted rights based on Magdeburg Law.\nBiecz enjoyed a cultural and economic renaissance during the 14th and 15th centuries. Beginning in the 17th century, the town was beset by a number of natural disasters, including flooding, fires, and a plague which killed all but 30 inhabitants. The town suffered heavy population losses during World War II, including a public massacre of 200 local Jews in the market square in 1942.\nBiecz is situated in an area which was inhabited as early as the Neolithic period, or about 4500 BCE. Stone artifacts dating to this period have been excavated within Biecz proper and the surrounding area. A hoard of copper alloy weapons and jewellery dating from the early Bronze Age was found in the vicinity of Biecz in the nineteenth century. Now in the British Museum, the hoard is famous for its rare conical helmet. During the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age, the area was home to the Lusatian culture. Pottery fragments were uncovered during archaeological work at the castle in 1961. Excavated Byzantine and Roman coins dating from the 2nd to the 5th centuries indicate that the area was part of an important trade route for these empires.\nA castle was erected as early as the 9th century, a small settlement quickly developing around its perimeter. This early castle was demolished by King Casimir IV Jagiellon in the 13th century and replaced with a much larger structure, now one of three surviving castles in the area. Biecz is first referenced by name in church documents written by Thietmar of Merseburg c. 1012\u20131018. In 1184, Casimir II the Just gave the land as tithes to St. Florian of Krak\u00f3w. Documents dating to 1243 and 1257 make reference to specific castellans: Nicolaus de Beycz and Bronisius de Begech.\nThe castle was a strategic military stronghold due to its location near the Polish border. It served as a preparation area for attacks on enemy states and a rallying point for forces resisting invasion. The stronghold also served as a center for trade due to its position at the crossroads between east-west and north-south trade routes between Red Ruthenia and Hungary.\nBiecz was granted its Magdeburg rights around the year 1257 CE, probably by Prince Boles\u0142aw V the Chaste of Krak\u00f3w. The exact year is unknown, as the royal edict granting these rights has not been preserved. These rights were confirmed by King Casimir III the Great in 1363, and then later by Queen Jadwiga. Trade relations with Bardejov across the Carpathians were also formalized during the 14th century.\nDuring the late 13th century, King Wenceslaus II gifted the town to Jan Muskata, bishop of Krak\u00f3w, in exchange for the territory where he would later found Nowy S\u0105cz. According to contemporary documents, the transfer of power occurred on 24 March 1303 in Prague.\nDuring the fall of 1306, ownership of the town and castle were peacefully transferred to the control of W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high. From this point forward, the town and municipality were under the control of the Polish crown. W\u0142adys\u0142aw I based his campaign to unify Poland from the castle of Biecz from September 1311 to April 1312. Due to the importance granted to the city during this period, Biecz was initially considered the capital city of Poland.\nInitially the town was protected by earthworks and ditches. Walls were first constructed during the 14th century, as evidenced by a royal edict issued by King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o (Jogaila) in 1399 ordering all able-bodied men to assist in the expansion and repair of the city walls. The walls were extended in the 16th century and again in the 17th, when seventeen towers were constructed to aid in the fortification and protection of the town.\nKing Casimir III the Great took great interest in the city. In 1361 he gave orders for the construction of weighing scales and textile mills, and established a number of fairs, which were major sources of income. In addition, he granted all Biecz business an exemption from taxation and tariffs, as well as economic benefit from surrounding villages.\nBiecz flourished under Jagiellonian rule. The crown's encouragement of growth and trade, as well as the town's favorable location, were major influences on Biecz's rapid growth during this period. Under the rule of King Casimir IV Jagiellon, the town built its first municipal water supply. Inhabitants were also granted a number of privileges, such as relief from duties on various imported commodities. Additionally, merchants entering Polish territory were required to pass through Biecz, wherein taxes and other import tariffs were levied. This practice was established by Louis I of Hungary in 1372 along the Hungarian-Red Ruthenian trade route.\nEconomic development prompted rapid population growth. By the end of the 14th century, Biecz had become one of the largest cities in all of Poland, with a population of over 3,000 in the city and its suburbs.\nAs a castellany, Biecz was not only entrusted with defensive responsibilities, but also served as judicial, administrative, and economic center for southern part of Krak\u00f3w Voivodeship. After a lull in economic and population growth in the latter half of the 14th century, the judiciary and administration of the region were reorganized. The region of Krak\u00f3w, or Krak\u00f3w Voivodeship was established, and was further split into six powiats (districts), one of which was the large district of Biecz. Biecz was then designated a judicial center, and was home to two different court systems. Krak\u00f3w, Nowy S\u0105cz, and Biecz were the locations of the high courts that dealt with the enforcement of the Magdeburg laws as established in 1374 by the Privilege of Ko\u0161ice.\nLittle is known about the establishment of the Biecz starostwo during the late 14th century. Nothing is known about the first recorded starosta but his name: Drago. The starostwo were Crown lands administered by the starosta, and established mainly for economic purposes as the Crown considered revenues generated by these administrative regions a significant source of income. The Biecz starostwo had a strong economic base; by 1581 it encompassed 23 villages and Crown-operated folwarks. Until 1641 the starosta had an office in the Franciscan monastery; after 1641 his office was moved to a designated administrative building.\nIn 1624, the reformed Franciscan order arrived in Biecz from Zakliczyn, where a substantial reformation had recently occurred under the guidance of Friar Hipolit \u0141owicjan and Father Piotr Zielonacki. In 1651 the Franciscan monastery was moved from its original location on the Ropa River to a new location closer to the city center.\nNumerous public and private buildings were built during the 15th and 16th centuries. On 25 July 1395, Queen Jadwiga issued building orders for the Szpital \u015bw. Ducha (Hospital of the Holy Ghost). The writ appropriated a nearby folwark, several fish ponts, and the remnants of a plaza that had been destroyed by fire in 1388. Funded entirely by tax revenue, the hospital's budget was the largest in the country.\nOver the years, many churches have been located in Biecz, the most ever being seven within the city limits. The most prominent of these is Corpus Christi Church (Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 Bo\u017cego Cia\u0142a). The oldest surviving structures date back to 1480, but the register of monuments of the Kingdom of Poland show that construction had already begun by 1326. The main nave was constructed during the 15th century and completed by 1519. The side chapels were built between 1521 and 1560, and the main altar was added in 1604.\nAnother important monument constructed during this period is City Hall. The original bell tower was constructed in 1569, and the rest of the structure was built between 1569 and 1580. The structure was built with funds donated by Marcin Kromer. Once construction on the tower was completed, the tradition of trumpeting the hejna\u0142 was begun. The hejna\u0142 was played every morning, noon, and evening, coinciding with the closing of the city gates, as well as in times of emergency.\nIn 1523, the Dom Barian\u00f3w-Rokickich was built. The building was owned by Marcin Kromer and served as a pharmacy until the 17th century. Other important period buildings include the 1519 Kromer House, which never actually had anything to do with Marcin Kromer, and the Castle, built in the first half of the 16th century.\nBiecz was a royal city, and the center of local administrative, judicial, and military authority from the 12th century until 1783. In the 17th century, the district of Biecz encompassed eleven cities and 264 villages, as well as three castles, the royal court, and several royal residences. Kings from both the Piast and Jagiellon dynasties made use of these royal residences. The royal residences remained in use by Polish monarchs until John II Casimir Vasa, who passed through the city while on his campaign to drive the Swedes from Poland.\nThe castle served as a center of economic exchange for many centuries, mainly due to its favorable location at the intersection of north\u2013south and east\u2013west trade routes.\nIn 1505, Alexander Jagiellon strengthened trade relations with Hungary. As a result, the majority of Hungarian exports to Polish territories and beyond were sent through Biecz. These goods include iron, copper, lead, salt, wool, and large quantities of Hungarian wine. Initially this wine was a poor trade good, as the liquor was so expensive that only the magnates could afford to buy it. Over time, however, it became a more common drink, and increasing quantities were exported. On 17 January 1618, the wine cellars built by Casimir the Great had a stock of 331 barrels of Hungarian wine.\nAs the major defensive stronghold of the region, Biecz was required to combat manifestations of lawlessness. Marauders would frequently attack trade caravans, their major targets being those carrying large quantities of Hungarian wine. The issue was so widespread that the local sejm designated a special committee to litigate the issue.\nAs attacks on merchants increased in frequency and severity, the government increased penalties for these types of crimes. The punishment was torture, usually flagellation, followed by execution. Afterwards, the head of the criminal would be mounted on a pole at the city gate to serve as a warning to others. The bodies of highwaymen were, according to tradition, hung from gibbets, which can be seen in the Hogenberg etching above. Though no longer in use, these gibbets can still be seen today.\nBiecz executioners also performed executions in nearby villages for a fee. According to financial records, in the year 1450 executioners were sent to the towns of Jas\u0142o, Ryman\u00f3w, Dukla, D\u0119bowiec, Rzesz\u00f3w, and Wojnicz.\nThe sheer number of executions enacted gave rise to the popular legend that there existed an executioners' school in Biecz. It is likely that this is the invention of a 19th-century author, as trade schools did not exist during the Middle Ages. Nevertheless, the legend is a popular one, and some historical scholars have even devoted time to study the possibility.\nAs the population grew, so did the variety of trade goods and handicrafts produced in the city. In the 14th century, there were 30 different types of goods produced in the city, most of which are cloth or canvas goods. Economic prosperity gave rise to a mentality that valued education, which prompted the 1528 opening of a new school building. In the 15th and 16th centuries, 150 Bieczan students studied at the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w, then still known as Akademia Krakowska. Most of these students returned to Biecz after completing their studies.\nBiecz was home to a number of famous artists, painters, poets, and writers, including Jan Matejko and Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski. The first panoramic painting of Biecz was created in 1617 by Georg Braun and Franz Hogenberg. Another famous depiction is J. Janson's copperplate Widok og\u00f3lny Biecza (\"General view of Biecz\"), which appears in Regni Poloni\u00e6 Ducatus Lituani\u00e6 novissima descriptio (1659). Biecz was also the subject of artworks created by numerous famous artists, including Tadeusz Rybkowski, J\u00f3zef Mehoffer, and Helena Krajewska. Biecz was the subject of Miron Bia\u0142oszewski's tpestry \u015aredniowieczny gobelin o Bieczu.\nThe economic development of Biecz resulted in a population boom. A census conducted by the judiciary from 1388 to 1398 lists the names of 515 heads of households. Taking into account that contemporary families consisted on average of six people, it is believed that Biecz and its suburbs had at least 3,000 residents. By the mid-16th century, Biecz had a population of 3,700, the highest population the city achieved during the Middle Ages. Starting in the 17th century, Biecz went into a decline, its population slipping to approximately 1800 people in the first half of the 17th century, and then to 462 inhabitants in 1662.\nStarting in the mid-17th century, the city began to decline due to the stationing of foreign troops, alterations in trade routes, and numerous natural disasters. Further devastation was caused by the Deluge, a series of disastrous wars with Sweden that left the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth in ruins. The invading Swedes razed houses, farms, peasant buildings, hospitals, and three wooden churches on the outskirts of the city.\nThe wine trade, which had sustained the city as trade waned, began to decline. Contemporary record-keeping shows a significant reduction in the stock of wine in the middle of the 17th century. As time went on, the wine trade dwindled further before eventually disappearing completely.\nOn 4 April 1770, Kierkor, the commander of a troop of 100 cavalry, mounted an attack from Biecz against the Imperial Russian Army in Siepietnica under the command of Iwan Drewicz (Russian: \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0414\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447). The cavalry were overwhelmed, and the Russian forces pursued the retreating troops and plundered Biecz.\nThe golden age of Biecz ended with the partition of Poland, after which the city was under Austrian rule. After the 1783 liquidation of the District of Biecz, the eastern portion of city hall, which was devoted to district administration, was demolished between 1815 and 1840.\nBy 1787, trade good production had declined such that there remained only eight trade guilds. The most prosperous of the remaining trades was weaving, with approximately thirty workshops. Another surviving craft was shoemaking, with fourteen workshops. The shoemaking profession soon disappeared, however, as industrialization allowed for mass production of much cheaper product.\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, Biecz was one of the largest Polish cities both in area and population. Beginning in the middle of that century, however, Biecz fell victim to a number of natural disasters which devastated both its population and infrastructure. In 1543, 110 inhabitants died from a plague; a second plague in 1572 claimed 1,500 victims. In 1600 Biecz suffered yet another plague, which struck again in 1622. This plague struck the workshops, nearly wiping out the tradesman population. 52 craftsmen survived. The same occurred in the next plague, which struct in 1652. In 1721, Biecz suffered what is now known as the great plague, which devastated the populace and spared approximately thirty people.\nIn 1776, the ruling Habsburg dynasty sold the city to the Siemie\u0144scy family, effectively revoking Biecz's status as a royal city. Initially the new administration provided a certain stability. However, in 1783, the city was forced to defend itself against invaders, forcing the administrative and judicial branches of government to shut down. The last Biecz castle still in service as a military stronghold fell to the invaders, who laid siege to the city. Effectively cut off from communication with the rest of the Austrian partition, and severed from the traditional Hungarian trade routes, the city withstood the invasion solely due to the recent renovation and strengthening of the city walls.\nBiecz began to recover economically beginning in the late 19th century. During this period, the petrochemical industry began to develop in the vicinity, which contributed to a number of personal fortunes through the years. In 1879, the first oil well was constructed in the Hart neighborhood, northwest of Biecz. Devastated areas were rebuilt and rejuvenated with money from these newly made oil fortunes. One of these nouveau riche, Father Jan Bochniewicz, established a charitable foundation with 50,000 PLN initial capital, a percentage of which was earmarked for distribution among the fifty poorest inhabitants of the city. The foundation survived until 1958.\nThe economic recovery and the inflow of capital to Biecz contributed positively to improving the quality of life. In 1882, Biecz constructed its first railroad station, and in 1889, its first credit union. Slowly education and culture returned to the city. In 1891 a new parochial school building was constructed, and in 1912 an all-girls school was opened. The 19th century brought with it an increased awareness of the historical value of buildings, and a subsequent increase in the conservation and protection of historic monuments. As a result, Biecz soon became the focus of interest of many art historians, professors, and conservators.\nOn 12 May 1903, a great fire broke out in Biecz, razing half of the city. According to historical documents, destroyed buildings included twenty Jewish stores, thirty Catholic homes, the tax collector's offices, a pharmacy, the newly built Synagogue, and old city hall. In total, 600 residents were left without homes.\nIn 1898, the city's public library, named after Tadeusz Kosciuszko, was opened and quickly became a cultural center. The original library was completely destroyed in the fire, but shortly thereafter was rebuilt and stocked with approximately 8,000 volumes.\nWhile World War I had little impact on the city proper, a number combatants who participated in the Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive are buried in cemeteries throughout the municipality.\nThere are five numbered cemeteries in Biecz wherein soldiers of World War I are buried:\n- cemetery no. 105, in Harcie, by the road to the communal cemetery.\n- cemetery no. 106, on Ulica Bochniewicza, was recently restored.\n- cemetery no. 107, along Ulica Tysi\u0105clecia, was originally a Jewish cemetery which was destroyed during World War II.\n- cemetery no. 108, by the Franciscan cloisters.\n- cemetery no. 109, on Ulica Parkowej.\nThe interwar period heralded new growth in Biecz. A number of societies were founded during this period, including the Zwi\u0105zek M\u0142odzie\u017cy Polskiej Polish Youth Union (1920) and the Towarzystwo Przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 Society of Friends (1938). The Society of Friends soon established the Muzeum Ziemi Bieckiej (Museum of Bieczan Lands).\nIn 1934, the Ropa River flooded, washing away railway embankments and all the houses built on the banks or valleys of the River. The floodwaters rose to unprecedented heights.\nThe outbreak of World War II abruptly halted all forms of cultural life. The War resulted in significant population losses, as well as the destruction of several buildings and cultural facilities. Many people were resettled in Biecz from towns like Jas\u0142o; by 1944 the total population of the city was 5,973 inhabitants.\nIn 1942 and 1943, the occupying Nazi forces carried out a number of Jewish massacres. In 1942, 200 Jewish citizens were publicly executed by the Nazis in the town square.\nNationalist and patriotic feelings were strong, and resistance forces quickly developed during both wars in the forms of National Army recruits and the Bataliony Ch\u0142opskie peasant battalions, as well as acts of violence and sabotage.\nAfter the war, Biecz began the process of reconstruction and preservation. The first new buildings constructed were related to education, and included several high schools and vocational schools. In 1949, a new public library was built, and in 1953, a regional museum. During the 1970s, new buildings included hotels, restaurants, cooperatives, a health center, and a public kindergarten. The 1980s saw the construction of 150 single-family homes.\nIn 1950\u20131953, the city hall bell tower was renovated and strengthened, and the cupola covered in sheet copper. Later the city embarked on a costly campaign to repair and preserve the outer sgraffito. Numerous preservation projects were ongoing during this period in Corpus Christi Church, such as the preservation of confessionals, altars, statues, and so forth. In 1992, the church gates of Corpus Christi Church were demolished. The gates dated back to the Renaissance.\nIn 1955, a memorial plaque was placed on the city hall bell tower to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of the death of Adam Mickiewicz. During the 1970s, the city built and dedicated a monument to the victims of the world wars. In 1989, a bust of Marcin Kromer and accompanying monument were dedicated on the 400th anniversary of his death.\nThe 21st century has been marked by numerous restoration and preservation projects. In 2000, renovation work was completed on the 15th-century bell tower. The 14th-century Corpus Christi Church has been the scene of a number of important restoration projects, including the 2004 restoration of the altar of St. Teresa of Avilla, 2002 restoration of the main altar, and 2005 replacement of a number of important structural support beams.\nIn March 2001, the Fundacja na Rzecz Szpitala Ubogich im. \u015bw. Jadwigi Kr\u00f3lowej w Bieczu was established as part of a campaign to save the Gothic Hospital of the Holy Ghost. Renovation and preservation work had already begun by 2004.\nOn 21 April 2005, the town government reinstated the tradition of playing the hejna\u0142. Beginning June 2009 of that year, the hejna\u0142 was played from the bell tower of town hall.\nBiecz was one of the towns to host the seventh annual Ma\u0142opolskie Dni Dziedzictwa Kulturowego (Lesser Poland cultural heritage day) from 20\u201321 May 2006. On 8 June 2006, relics of Queen Jadwiga of Poland, the patron saint of Biecz, were brought to the town for a dedicated exhibition. The relics were processed along a number of city and country roads that the Queen probably walked. \nOn 1 July 2007, Biecz celebrated the 750-year anniversary of the city's establishment under Magdeburg law. The festival was marked by dance performances, musical exhibitions, theater, and lectures by historical experts.\nOn 16 October 2008, the Biecz beltway was officially opened.\nWith a population of approximately 5,000, Biecz ranks as the 44th most populous city in Lesser Poland Voivodeship. As the city prospered and grew, so did the population. In the 14th century, the district of Biecz, including the surrounding villages, had a total population of 522. By the mid-16th century, this number was 3,700, and by the early 17th century had fallen back down to approximately 1,800.\nDuring the first half of the 16th century, Biecz was one of the largest Polish cities both in size and population. The wars with Sweden as well as numerous fires caused the population to begin to decrease. In 1721, a great plague struck Biecz. The thirty survivors built a memorial chapel to St. Michael the Archangel in memory of the victims. Nazi occupation during World War II resulted in significant population losses. A number of smaller villages were resettled into Biecz during this time, resulting, in 1944, in a population of 5,973, the highest recorded population in history.\nIn recent years, Biecz has slowly begun to decrease in population once more. There exists a migration trend that moves populations from cities to larger cities and abroad, mostly due to high unemployment and lack of higher education institutions. According to census records, in 2007 the city had 4,575 inhabitants, about 73 fewer than in the previous year.\nIn Biecz there are 107 women for every 100 men. The number of women in an age group is greater than the number of men for all age groups except the following: 5-19, 30-34, and 40-44.\nDue to its long, rich history, Biecz is home to a number of culturally and historically significant monuments and buildings. Some of the most important of these include the 14th-century Corpus Christi Church, the 15th-century town hall bell tower, and the 14th-century hospital of the Holy Ghost.\nCorpus Christi Church (Polish: Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 Bo\u017cego Cia\u0142a) is Polish Brick Gothic church dating back to the early 14th century. One of the most important churches in Poland, it houses the relics of Queen Jadwiga. The church is built of stone and brick, and decorated with patterns of strongly fired bricks.\nThe oldest part of the church is the presbytery, which was completed before 1480. This date was inscribed on a support beam, and probably indicates the year in which expansion was begun. According to the monument registry of the Kingdom of Poland, construction first began in 1326. The presbytery entrance is framed by a 15th-century painted screen of the Passion of Jesus Christ. To the sides are 17th-century stalls. A music pulpit that dates back to 1633, and which is the oldest such monument of its kind in Europe, can be found on the altar.\nThe altar was built in 1604. The altarpiece includes an image of the cross, circled by St. Michael the Archangel. It is one of three such images in the world. Above the painting is a scene showing the fatigue of the Mother of God, painted by Stanislas Stoss, son of Veit Stoss. At the top is the coronation of Mary. To the left of the altar is the 17th-century lesser altar of the Immaculate Conception, which features the family tree of Mary.\nOn either side of the presbytery are 17th-century, richly carved stalls. To the left is the Oratorium, where, according to legend, St. Jadwiga often prayed. In 2006, a shrine was added to the Oratorium to hold the relics of St. Jadwiga.\nThe church has eight chapels. Each chapel has a patron and guild dedicated to it. The chapels are: \n- chapel of Marcin Kromer (tailors guild)\n- chapel of St. Anthony of Padua (shoemakers guild)\n- chapel of Holy Mother (carpenters guild)\n- chapel of St. Michael the Archangel (weavers guild)\n- chapel of Bonar\u00f3w, Wielkopolska and Lig\u0119z\u00f3w\n- chapel of St. John Cantius (bakers guild)\n- chapel of St. Tekla (butchers guild)\n- chapel of St. Joseph (blacksmiths guild)\nThe main nave was added in 1519, and consists of a huge stone vault supported by eight stone pillars. A hanging pulpit was added in 1604. On the left of the chancel is the altar of Our Lady of the Rosary, alongside sculptures of Piotr Su\u0142owski, Saint Anne, and Miko\u0142aj Lig\u0119za. Near the Kromer and St. Anthony chapels is a memorial plaque to the 400th anniversary of Marcin Kromer's death.\nThe wooden choir loft was built in 1898 by organmaster Jan \u015aliwi\u0144ski. The organ has 22 voices, 2 manual and keyboard foot pedals. The instrument itself was designed by S\u0142awomir Odrzywolski. The choir stalls date back to the Renaissance period.\nAlongside the church is a 15th-century bell tower that was initially intended to serve as a defensive tower under the auspices of the butchers guild. The bell dates back to the 14th century. Since World War II, the bell has been on display in the Kromer House museum. The belltower is built alongside the 19th-century chapel of St. Barbara that was built over the ruins of a 15th-century chapel.\nThe outer walls of the church are decorated with Hungarian-sculpted statues of the Apostles.\nThe originally Gothic town hall was rebuilt in the 16th century, and served as the center of administrative power for the powiat of Biecz. After the First Partition of Poland, the powiat was dissolved, and the parts of the building dedicated to its administration fell into disuse. In the 19th century, the eastern wing of the hall was demolished. These foundations were discovered during a 1958 archaeological excavation of market square. Today these foundations are marked with commemorative plates.\nThe old bell tower collapsed from disrepair on 8 May 1569. It was rebuilt from 1569 to 1580 with funds donated by Marcin Kromer. The tower stands at in height, the highest building in the town. The walls are sgraffitoed plaster simulating the appearance of rustication.\nInside hang numerous crests and coats of arms, including that of Marcin Kromer and Adam Mickiewicz. On the east wall is a 16th-century 24-hour clock face. This style of clock is rare, as the 17th century brought with it a switch to 12-hour clock faces.\nThe bell tower's ornate cap burned in the great city fire on 12 May 1903. During the process of reconstruction, the cap was rebuilt with wooden shingles, which in 1998 were covered with sheet copper. Historically, a trumpeter played the hejna\u0142 from this tower when the city gates were opened, morning, noon, and night. This tradition ended with the collapse of the old bell tower, which killed the town trumpeter. In 2005, the tradition was restarted, and today the hejna\u0142 is played every day at noon.\nThe lowest levels of the tower include a dungeon called Turm. Convicts scratched primitive calendars and other inscriptions into the walls, which are still visible to this day. Today, the dungeons include an exhibition of prison cells, and an exhibition dedicated to medieval torture instruments.\nThe Hospital of the Holy Spirit (Polish: Szpital \u015bw. Ducha) is the oldest preserved hospital in Poland. The Catholic church first began establishing hospitals in Western Europe during the 8th century. The first Polish hospitals were established during the 13th century, where they were administered by various religious orders. Each hospital had an attached parish and church.\nBy the late 14th century, Biecz had accumulated a population of over 3,000 residents, necessitating some form of public health service. On 25 July 1395, Queen Jadwiga signed a royal edict ordering the construction of the hospital, granting tax breaks for the duration of construction, and earmarking two fiefs, a folwark, 3 fish ponds, and a town square near the city walls for construction. The budget provided by the queen for construction was one of the largest of its kind in the country.\nIn the 18th century, the church attached to the hospital was demolished, and in the 19th century, the hospital was renovated. The hospital continued to administer to the poor until 1950, when it was converted into a boys' boarding school. After a new school building had been built, the hospital was abandoned, and began to fall into a state of disrepair. Attempts to restore the buildings began during the 1980s, but were disrupted due to political changes in Poland. Due to difficult economic times during from 1991\u201397, only the walls and roofs have been preserved at present.\nThe hospital is in the eastern part of the city, and consists of a two-story building measuring . The eastern and western walls are decorated with patterns made from dark, strongly fired bricks. The eastern wall has two entries, while the west has one stone entry that has since been walled over. Above the stone entryway is a stone sculpture of the Polish coat of arms with the date 1487, that was probably moved there from the remnants of the third castle during the 17th century.\nThe Kromer House (Polish: Dom Kromera) is a 16th-century building that never actually belonged to Marcin Kromer. Built in 1519, only seven years after Kromer's birth, the building belonged to the wealthy Chodor\u00f3w family.\nToday the building houses a cultural museum that includes a number of important folk artifacts, art, and coins. The oldest exhibits include axeheads and related neolithic artefacts, as well as Roman and Byzantine coins, and medieval ceramics and weaponry. Other exhibits showcase historical weaponry and the day-to-day life of townspeople throughout history.\nThe city walls date back to the beginnings of the 14th century, when approximately 1,200 meters of walls protected the city. During the course of history, the city's defense systems altered to reflect the changing technologies of war, and today there remain only fragments of the original defenses. These fragments can be seen near Corpus Christi Church and the hospital of the Holy Ghost.\nOf the seventeen original towers, only three remain standing:\n- Kowalska tower, or smith's tower, which currently houses a museum exhibition.\n- Rze\u017anick tower, the bell tower.\n- Radziecka tower, or the municipal commissioner's tower, which also houses a museum exhibition, and which is also known as the House of Barian Rokicki.\nIn 1964, the foundations of one of Poland's best-known barbicans was discovered near Corpus Christi Church.\nDuring the course of history, there existed three separate castles in Biecz. Currently, only the ruins of one of these remain. Of the other two castles, one was built in the current location of the Franciscan church, while the other was located on land owned by the hospital.\nOnly the foundations remain of the Gothic royal castle on nearby G\u00f3rze Zamkowej (literally Castle Mountain). The castle was built on the foundations of an early medieval gord. Built in the 13th century, the castle was made of fortified stone, and served as field headquarters for Polish kings and princes.\nThe entire hill was surrounded by a rectangular defensive wall. The northern gate was guarded by a tower, bridge, and gates. The southern wall was protected by the Ropa River.\nThe castle ceased to be considered an important line of defense during the second half of the 15th century. In 1475, King Casimir IV Jagiellon ordered the castle's demolition. Large pieces of stonework and related ruins were scattered across the nearby countryside as late as the 19th century. Today, all that is visible is the foundation of the castle, which has been preserved for posterity.\nThere are 3 bus stops and one railway station. There are 4 schools. The main industries are trade, services and tourism. There is one cinema.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 1298, "sectionHeading": "Toponym", "sectionLabel": "city.other"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1298, "length": 561, "sectionHeading": "Toponym | Heraldry", "sectionLabel": "city.other"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1859, "length": 1241, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3100, "length": 245, "sectionHeading": "Geography | Climate", "sectionLabel": "city.climate"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3345, "length": 346, "sectionHeading": "Districts", "sectionLabel": "city.district"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3691, "length": 1172, "sectionHeading": "Districts | Neighborhoods", "sectionLabel": "city.district"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4863, "length": 740, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5603, "length": 752, "sectionHeading": "History | Prehistory", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6355, "length": 950, "sectionHeading": "History | Early Middle Ages", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7305, "length": 1572, "sectionHeading": "History | Magdeburg rights", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 8877, "length": 9186, "sectionHeading": "History | Golden age", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 18063, "length": 3115, "sectionHeading": "History | Decline", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 21178, "length": 1884, "sectionHeading": "History | 1850\u20131914", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 23062, "length": 1833, "sectionHeading": "History | World Wars", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 24895, "length": 1265, "sectionHeading": "History | Post World War II", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 26160, "length": 1511, "sectionHeading": "History | 21st century", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 27671, "length": 1531, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 29202, "length": 297, "sectionHeading": "Monuments", "sectionLabel": "city.sights"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 29499, "length": 3114, "sectionHeading": "Monuments | Corpus Christi Church", "sectionLabel": "city.facility"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 32613, "length": 1824, "sectionHeading": "Monuments | Town Hall", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 34437, "length": 1932, "sectionHeading": "Monuments | Holy Spirit Hospital", "sectionLabel": "city.health"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 36369, "length": 580, "sectionHeading": "Monuments | House of Kromer", "sectionLabel": "city.sights"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 36949, "length": 827, "sectionHeading": "Monuments | City walls", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 37776, "length": 1152, "sectionHeading": "Monuments | Castle", "sectionLabel": "city.sights"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 38928, "length": 142, "sectionHeading": "Transport, education and economy", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennis,_Texas", "type": "city", "title": "Ennis, Texas", "abstract": "Ennis is a city in eastern Ellis County, Texas, United States, located south of Dallas. The population was 18,513 at the 2010 census, up from 16,454 at the 2000 census. It is the third largest city in Ellis County with the county seat Waxahachie being the most populous, followed by the city of Midlothian. The city is also home to the National Polka Festival.\nEnnis is located in the southeastern portion of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.\n", "text": "In 1872 the Houston and Central Texas Railroad (H&TC) arrived at the spot that would become Ennis. The city is named for Cornelius Ennis, an official of the railroad. Ennis served as Mayor of Houston (1856\u201357), and as a director of the Houston Tap and Brazoria Railway and H&TC.\nBetween 1874 and 1890, the population grew from 300 to 3,000. Many of the settlers came from the war-torn Confederate States of America and others came from the war-ravaged European nations that later became Czechoslovakia.\nIn 1891, the H&TC chose Ennis as its northern division headquarters in an agreement requiring that Ennis provide water for the railroad. The machine shops and roundhouse employed several hundred men. One condition of the agreement was that as long as Ennis was able to furnish water the shops could not be moved from the community. The city built the first of three lakes for this purpose in 1892, followed by another in 1895, and the last in 1940 \nOn July 14, 1902, the Corsicana Oil Citys of the Texas League moved that day's game against Texarkana to Ennis, due to Sunday blue laws in Coriscana. Future major-leaguer Nig Clarke set an all-time record by hitting eight home runs in ten at bats in a 51\u20133 victory. (Clarke was helped mightily by the fact that Ennis' tiny ballpark featured a right field fence only about 210 feet from home plate.)\nThe railroad also led to the expansion of the cotton industry, providing access to foreign and domestic markets through the port of Houston. By 1920, a total of 152,601 bales of cotton were ginned and shipped from Ellis County, the most of any county in America. The Ennis Chamber of Commerce adopted the slogan 'Where Railroads and Cotton Fields Meet.\"\nRailroads and cotton produced the wealth that could be seen in the residential development of the city. Residents built beautiful churches of many different denominations and numerous fraternal organizations met regularly. Elegant houses along \u201cthe Avenue\u201d and north were accompanied by dozens of Folk Victorian houses and Craftsman style bungalows.\nBy mid-twentieth century Ennis had become a modern community with schools, three movie theaters, several drugstores, banks and automobile dealerships. The sons and daughters of early settlers had developed new traditions like the National Polka Festival and the Ennis Bluebonnet Trail. Moreover, the city was connected to Dallas to the north and Houston to the South by Interstate Highway 45. Since then, citizens of Ennis have been able to experience the best of two worlds, participation in the attractions of a large, dynamic city and the familiar street-scape of a unique, nurturing community.\nThe commercial strip along Ennis Ave. between Downtown and Interstate 45 was hit by a tornado in the tornado outbreak of May 15\u201317, 2013, rendering four homes uninhabitable and damaging as many as 55 businesses. The damage caused by the EF1 impacted the National Register Historic District and many of the other businesses in town, some of which are pending demolition. However, these damaged buildings were purchased by developers in the hopes of revitalizing the Downtown Historical District. These revitalization plans were implemented in the Downtown Comprehensive Plan, and the city was re-admitted to the Texas Main Street Program in January 2015. Today, the downtown area is home to several successful start-ups, with future plans calling for further emphasis on local business, pedestrian friendliness, and the development of parks, plazas, and new urbanist development along the outskirts of the district.\nEnnis is in the northeastern region of Texas, in eastern Ellis County. Interstate 45 passes through the east side of the city, with access from Exits 247 through 255. I-45 leads north to Dallas and south to Houston.

This invasion caused the United States to purchase Florida from Spain and the territory became a part of the U.S. in 1821.\nThe City of Blountstown was named for John Blount, a Seminole Indian Chief. Blount was a guide for General Andrew Jackson who invaded Spanish Florida in 1818. This invasion caused the United States to purchase Florida from Spain and the territory became a part of the U.S. in 1821. \nJohn Blount was rewarded for his services to General Jackson with a trip to Washington, D.C. to visit the President. In 1823, he was granted a reservation along the west side of the Apalachicola River, four miles by two miles square. Blount and his tribe traded with the American and English trading companies while living on his reservation. Several trading posts were located on the \"Big River\" and the Gulf of Mexico. \nChief Blount had several hundred head of cattle, which grazed in the area. The earlier settlers near the reservation were allowed to slaughter the cattle with Blount being paid in the cattle hides. The hides were placed in canoes and carried down stream to Apalachicola and exchanged for supplies for the Indian people. \nThere were many products sold by the Indian for such items as cloth, shoes, knives, coffee, and guns. An unusual product was bees' honey and wax. Thousands of trees grew near the Blount lands, which had beehives in their hollows. The warriors would go to the trees at night and secure the honey and wax that was traded to the merchants. The wild bear liked honey and would climb the trees and rob the bees of their honey. The Indian could usually discover a honey or bee tree when a bear lost his hold on the tree and fell to his death at the foot of the tree. \nThe U.S. government eventually purchased Blount's reservation and transported the tribe to Texas. The cotton planter then settled the rich river bottomland and planted cotton, which furnished the clothing mills in England. The cotton planter used the steamboats to travel to Columbus, Georgia and sometimes to foreign countries. He bought many fine articles for his household which included ice transported from the Great Lakes. The cotton economy declined after the Civil War and large forests furnished trees, which were floated down the Apalachicola River on rafts and manufactured into lumber. \nIn 1880, Blountstown became the County seat of Calhoun County and a courthouse was built near the river. In 1903, another courthouse was constructed in \"new\" Blountstown. This courthouse was used until 1973 when the new courthouse was constructed.

According to the 2010 census, the population of the city was 5,575. The city is the county seat of Cochise County.\n", "text": "Bisbee was founded as a copper, gold, and silver mining town in 1880, and named in honor of Judge DeWitt Bisbee, one of the financial backers of the adjacent Copper Queen Mine.\nIn 1929, the county seat was moved from Tombstone to Bisbee, where it remains.\nMining in the Mule Mountains proved quite successful: in the early 20th century the population of Bisbee soared. Incorporated in 1902, by 1910 its population had swelled to 9,019, and it sported a constellation of suburbs, including Warren, Lowell, and San Jose, some of which had been founded on their own (ultimately less successful) mines. In 1917, open-pit mining was successfully introduced to meet the copper demand during World War I.\nA high quality turquoise promoted as Bisbee Blue was a by-product of the copper mining. Many high-quality mineral specimens have come from Bisbee area mines and are to be found in museum collections worldwide. Some of these minerals include cuprite, aragonite, wulfenite, malachite, azurite, and galena.\nMiners attempted to organize to gain better working conditions and wages. In 1917, the Phelps Dodge Corporation, using private police, transported at gun point over 1,000 striking miners out of town to Hermanas, New Mexico, due to allegations that they were members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW); the company wanted to prevent unionization. Earlier that year, industry police conducted the Jerome Deportation, a similar event to expel striking miners.\nContinued underground work enabled the town to survive changes in mining. Neighboring towns had mines that closed, with a resulting dramatic loss of population. But, by 1950, the population of Bisbee had dropped to less than 6,000. In 1975 the Phelps Dodge Corporation halted its Bisbee copper-mining operations.\nBisbee Mayor Chuck Eads, with cooperation of Phelps Dodge, implemented development of a mine tour and historic interpretation of a portion of the world-famous Copper Queen Mine as part of an effort to create heritage tourism as another base for the economy. They worked to compensate for the economic loss due to the end of the mining industry in the area.\nCommunity volunteers cleared tons of fallen rock and re-timbered the old workings. Eventually, this local effort came to the attention of the federal Economic Development Administration. It approved a large grant to the City of Bisbee to help the mine tour project and other improvements in downtown Bisbee; these were designed to meet tourist business needs. The Queen Mine Tour was officially opened to visitors on February 1, 1976. More than a million visitors have taken the underground mine tour train.\nFrom 1950 to 1960, the sharp population decline changed and the number of residents of Bisbee increased by nearly 160 percent when open-pit mining was undertaken and the city annexed nearby areas. The peak population was in 1960, at 9,914.\nIn the following decade, there was a decline in jobs and population, although not as severe as from 1930 to 1950. But, the economic volatility resulted in a crash in housing prices. Coupled with an attractive climate and picturesque scenery, Bisbee became a destination in the 1960s for artists and hippies of the counter culture.\nArtist Stephen Hutchison and his wife Marcia purchased the Copper Queen Hotel, the town's anchor business and architectural gem, from the Phelps-Dodge mining company in 1970. The company had tried to find a local buyer, offering the deed to any local resident for the sum of $1, but there were no takers. The property needed renovation for continued use.\nHutchison purchased and renovated the hotel, as well as other buildings in the downtown area. One held the early 20th-century Brewery and Stock Exchange. Hutchison began to market Bisbee as a destination of the \"authentic,\" old Southwest. His work attracted the developer Ed Smart.\nAmong the many guests at the hotel have been celebrities from nearby California. Actor John Wayne was a frequent visitor to Bisbee and the Copper Queen. He befriended Hutchison and eventually partnered with Smart in his real estate ventures. This period of Bisbee's history is well documented in contemporary articles in The New Yorker and in an article by Cynthia Buchanan in The Cornell Review. It was at this time that Bisbee became a haven for artists and hippies fleeing the larger cities of Arizona and California. Later it attracted people priced out by gentrification of places such as Aspen, Colorado.\nIn the 1990s, additional people have been attracted to Bisbee, leading it to develop such amenities as coffee shops and live theatre. Many of the old houses have been renovated, and property values in Bisbee now greatly exceed those of other southeastern Arizona cities.\nToday, the historic city of Bisbee is known as \"Old Bisbee\" and is home to a thriving downtown cultural scene. This area is noted for its architecture, including Victorian-style houses and an elegant Art Deco county courthouse. Because its plan was laid out to a pedestrian scale before the automobile, Old Bisbee is compact and walkable. The town's hilly terrain is exemplified by the old four-story high school; each floor has a ground-level entrance.\nIn the May\u2013June 2000 issue of Modern Maturity, the AARP highlighted what they called the most \"alive\" places to retire in the U.S. Bisbee was a runner-up as one of the \"quirkiest\" towns in America.\nThe city of Bisbee now includes the satellite communities of Warren, Lowell, and San Jose. The Lowell and Warren townsites were consolidated into Bisbee proper during the early part of the twentieth century. There are also smaller neighborhoods interspersed between these larger boroughs, including Galena, Bakerville, Tintown, South Bisbee, Briggs, and Saginaw.\nWarren was Arizona's first planned community. It was designed as a bedroom community for the more affluent citizens of the mining district. Warren has a fine collection of Arts and Crafts style bungalow houses. Many have been recognized as historic places, and the city has an annual home tour during which a varying selection are offered for tours. Since the end of mining in the 1970s, Warren has seen a steady decline in its standard of living. The residential district still houses a significant portion of the population, and includes City Hall, Greenway Elementary School, Bisbee High School, and the historic Warren Ballpark.\nLowell was at one time a sizable mining town located just to the southeast of Old Bisbee. The majority of the original townsite was consumed by the excavation of the Lavender Pit mine during the 1950s. All that is left today is a small portion of Erie Street, along with Evergreen Cemetery, Saginaw subdivision and Lowell Middle School. These days Lowell is considered by most of the local residents to be more of a place name than an operating community.\nSan Jose, on the southern side of the Mule Mountains, is the most modern of the city's subdivisions. As it is not restricted by mountains, it has had the most new growth since the late 1990s. Named after a nearby Mexican mountain peak, it is the location of many newer county government buildings, the Huachuca Terrace Elementary School, and a large shopping center.\nIn 2007, in what has been noted as the world's biggest-ever mining takeover, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold bought Phelps Dodge Mining. It began preliminary mining work in the area. Full mine operations began in 2013 with the mining of gold in addition to copper. Free-Port has invested in Bisbee by remediating soil contaminated in previous mining operations, donations to the school system, and other civic activities. \nThe Bisbee 1000 Stair Climb is a five-kilometer run through the city that traverses 1,034 stairs. Billed as \"the most unique physical fitness challenge in the USA!\" by the organizers, the Climb includes runners being serenaded by musicians at various locations among the stairs. The event has grown to include the Ice Man Competition, designed to honor the history of men delivering blocks of ice by hand before the advent of refrigeration. In the Ice Man Competition, entrants race up 155 steps carrying a ten-pound block of ice with antique ice tongs.\nBisbee also hosts an annual Blues festival, occurring in 2015 during the second week of September. The festival effectively lengthens the tourist season, and provides a large amount of business to local bars and breweries.\nIn 2016, Bisbee earned the title of Best Historic Small Town in both Sunset magazine and a USA Today online reader poll. Jen Luria, director of tourism in Bisbee, credited the power of social media and comedian Doug Stanhope in the USA Today win. July 3, 2016 was declared \"Killer Termites Day\" after Doug Stanhope's tenacious social media followers, The Killer Termites, persistently voted for Bisbee in the online poll.\nNaco, Arizona, is a small unincorporated border community some three miles south of the San Jose district of Bisbee. It straddles the Mexico\u2013United States border and is the site of an official port of entry. Naco features a U.S. post office, an elementary school, and several businesses, including a small store, garage, and saloon.\nBisbee Junction (formerly Osborn or Osborn Junction) is located four miles south of Warren. It was originally a railroad siding where ore trains from the Bisbee mines joined with the main Southern Pacific Railroad line. A Southern Pacific depot and U.S. Post Office building, in the style of the first half of the 20th century, were located at the railroad junction. The depot and post office were closed in the late 1950s and the building was razed soon afterward. A dance hall, an Elks club and small dry goods store were once located near the depot. The community was once the location of several cattle ranches and dairies. The Arizona Cactus Botanical Garden was located in Bisbee Junction.\nArizona State Route 80 runs through the city, leading northwest to Tombstone and to Benson, and east to Douglas. The Mexican border at Naco is south of the center of Bisbee.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.\nNatural vegetation around Bisbee has a semi-desert appearance with shrubby acacia, oak and the like, along with cacti, grass, ocotillo and yucca. The town itself is much more luxuriant with native trees such as cypress, sycamore and cottonwood plus the introduced ailanthus and Old World cypresses, cedars and pines. Palms are capable of large size, but are not reliably hardy. A few higher-elevation trees such as blue spruce and white fir are growing fairly well in Bisbee.\nBisbee has the typical semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen BSk) of the upland Mountain West. Summer days are warm to hot and dry before the monsoon brings the wettest season from July to September with of Bisbee's total annual rainfall of , often with severe thunderstorms. During the winter, frontal cloudbands may bring occasional rainfall or even snowfall, though average maxima in the winter are typically very mild and sometimes even warm.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 6,090 people, 2,810 households, and 1,503 families residing in the city.

The average household size was 2.15 and the average family size was 2.90.\nAn analysis of United States Census Bureau data by researchers at The Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law found that, on a proportional basis, Bisbee had more gay couples living together than anywhere else in the state. The ratio was 20.9 for every 1,000 households.\nIn the city, the age distribution of the population shows 21.6% under the age of 18, 6.8% from 18 to 24, 24.1% from 25 to 44, 27.8% from 45 to 64, and 19.6% who were 65 years of age or older.

Pond Town was first settled in 1851.\nSalem was later named after New Salem, Massachusetts, the birthplace of Lyman Curtis, to honor his contributions to the community. Curtis was known to be good with a gun, and was a bodyguard for the prophet Joseph Smith. He was a member of Zions Camp. He also was in the discovery party of nine riders that first rode on horseback into the Salt Lake Valley in July 1847. He was not officially recognized as one of the nine riders. The other eight have been recognized, though the ninth rider is stated to be unknown.

The current mayor is James R. Fouts, who was elected to his first mayoral term in November 2007.\n", "text": "Beebe's Corners, the original settlement in what would become the city of Warren, was founded in 1830 at the corner of Mound Road and Chicago Road; its first resident was Charles Groesbeck. Beebe's Corners was a carriage stop between Detroit and Utica, and included a distillery, mill, tavern, and trading post. It was not until 1837 that the now-defunct Warren Township was organized around the settlement, first under the name Hickory, then renamed Aba in April 1838, and finally renamed Warren shortly thereafter. It was named for War of 1812 veteran, and frontier cleric, Rev. Abel Warren. However, when it was originally organized the township was named for Rev. Warren who was a Methodist Episcopal preacher who left his native New York in 1824 for Shelby Township. He went throughout the present-day Macomb, Lapeer, Oakland, and St. Clair Counties, baptizing, marrying, and burying pioneers of the area, as well as establishing congregations and preaching extensively. He was the first licensed preacher in the State of Michigan.\nAnother version of the source of the city's name claims it was \"named for General Joseph Warren (1741\u20131775), who fell at the Battle of Bunker Hill.\nThe settlement was formally incorporated as the Village of Warren from Warren Township on April 28, 1893 out of one square mile bound by 14 Mile Road and 13 Mile Road to the north and south, and in half-a-mile east and west of Mound Road. The small village grew slowly, and had a population of 582 in 1940 and 727 in 1950, while the larger surrounding township grew at a much quicker pace.\nThe Red Run and Bear Creek, just small creeks back in the 1800s, has blossomed into an open major inter-county stormdrain flowing through Warren, into the Clinton River, and onwards to Lake St. Clair.\nThe Village of Warren and most of the surrounding Township of Warren incorporated as a city in 1957, less the city of Center Line, which had incorporated as a village from Warren Township in 1925 and as a city in 1936. Between 1950 and 1960, Warren's population soared from 42,653 to 89,426. This population explosion was fueled by the post-WWII Baby Boom and later, by white flight from its southern neighbor of Detroit in that decade. This change in population continued into the next decade when the city's population doubled again, ultimately reaching a high of 179,000 in 1970.\nThe subsequent decades have seen Warren's population decline, while violent crime has increased as Demographics have shifted. This has led Warren to a number 7 ranking in Forbes' Most Miserable Cities to Live in the US; joining two other Michigan cities, Detroit and Flint, in the Top 10.\nThe following is a list of the previous mayors of the city. The current mayor is James Fouts. Mayoral elections are currently non-partisan.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The city covers a six-mile-by-six mile (10 km x 10 km) square in the southwest corner of Macomb County in suburban Detroit (minus Center Line, which is a small city totally enclosed within Warren). Other cities bordering on Warren are Detroit, Hazel Park, Madison Heights, Sterling Heights, Fraser, Roseville, and Eastpointe.\nMound Road is an important north-south artery in the city. East-west travel is mainly on the mile roads.

Warren was one of the fastest-growing municipalities in the country between 1940 and 1970, roughly doubling its population every 10 years. In 1940 the official population of Warren Township was 22,146; in 1950, it was 42,653; in 1960, after Warren Township had become the City of Warren, population had risen to 89,240; and by 1970 it had grown to 179,260.\nSince 1970, Warren has been consistently one of the faster-declining cities in population in the country.

By 1964, the number of inhabitants had fallen to 175 and decreased to just 25 in 1970.\nInitially known as \"Marvin\", the community was renamed after the railroad arrived in 1882, to honor rail division superintendent Everett B. Eddy. By the mid-1880s, the community was home to 150 people, three general stores, two churches, a school, and a gristmill. Throughout the 1890s, Eddy continued to experience rapid growth, with some estimates placing the total population as high as 700. A bank opened in 1901 and received a national charter in 1915. In 1928, the schools in Bruceville and Eddy were consolidated, the first such merger in McLennan County. By the late 1920s, Eddy had approximately 450 residents.

In May 1890 there were only a couple of dwellings scattered around the area that is Claxton. Hendricks, son of Glenn and Nancy Hendricks, had been given a large tract of land by his parents. The Hendricks's ambition was to secure a railroad station at the site, but they met considerable opposition from railroad company officials who maintained that existing stations in the area were sufficient to meet the needs. W.R. Hendricks made a proposition to railroad officials that a well be dug and pump installed free of charge so that trains could stop for water. The deal was made and actual construction began in the latter part of June 1890. The vision of building a town was fully supported by Hendricks's mother, who offered to give a lot to anyone who would erect a building upon it. A number of people accepted her offer, so she revised the plan and proposed to sell one lot and give an adjoining parcel to ones who desired to build.\nWith the establishment of a town well underway, efforts were begun to establish a post office at the settlement already widely known as \"Hendricks\". Postal officials in Washington, D.C., upon receiving an application from George E. Wood, declined to approve the name, because a post office in the state was already operating under that name in Upson County. Two other names were then submitted, \"Jenny\" and \"Claxton\". Postal officials agreed to Claxton, and the post office opened in 1890.\nThere is some dispute about the origin of the name. Some local historians contend that the name of a popular actress, Kate Claxton, was the source, while others believe it was in honor of Philander Priestly Claxton, a noted educator of the time.\nShortly after the Claxton post office opened, D.C. Newton, one of the partners in a naval stores company, laid out on a sheet of brown wrapping paper what became the original map of Claxton. Newton drew in the streets, laid out lots and later added street names. The whereabouts of the original map is not known; however, it is believed that this first map remained in his possession until his death and was passed down to his son who died in the 1990s.

The Council of Friends membership desired a remote location where they could practice plural marriage, which had been publicly abandoned by the LDS Church in 1890. On July 26, 1953, Arizona Governor John Howard Pyle sent troops into the settlement to stop polygamy in what became known as the Short Creek raid. The two-year legal battle that followed became a public relations disaster that damaged Pyle's political career and set a hands-off tone toward the town in Arizona for the next 50 years. \nAfter the death of Joseph W. Musser, the community split into two groups. Those were the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, which stayed in Short Creek, and the Apostolic United Brethren which relocated to Bluffdale, Utah. The FLDS Church changed the name to Colorado City and Hildale to eliminate any ties to the Short Creek raids.\nOn April 6, 2010, law enforcement officials in Mohave County, Arizona and Washington County, Utah served five search warrants seeking records from town officers. The warrants were served on government officials and departments, including Town Manager David Darger as well as Colorado City's fire chief. As a result of the initial warrants, the Hildale-Colorado City Department of Public Safety was shut down, and emergency responders were prohibited from responding to calls without the approval of county officials.

The Cooke family moved to the Short Creek area in 2008 but were refused access to utilities by the towns of Colorado City and Hildale. As a result of the ruling, Arizona's Attorney General Tom Horne issued a press release stating that he \"wants to eradicate discrimination in two polygamous towns\" and believes that the court ruling will give him the tools to do it.\nOn September 14, 2015, at least 12 members of two related families from the community were killed in a flash flood while waiting for a low water crossing to clear at the mouth of Maxwell Canyon in Hildale.

Kollam Port was founded by Mar Sabor at Tangasseri in 825 as an alternative to reopening the inland sea port of Kore-ke-ni Kollam near Backare (Thevalakara), which was also known as Nelcynda and Tyndis to the Romans and Greeks and as Thondi to the Tamils.\n", "text": "Kollam is a coastal city on the banks of Ashtamudi Lake that took the title God's Own Country without much demur. The Ashtamudi Lake lie about north of the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram. The city hosts the administrative offices of Kollam district and is a prominent trading city for the state. The proportion of females to males in Kollam city is second highest among the 500 most populous cities in India. Kollam is the least polluted city in India.\nFour major trading centers/towns around Kollam are Kottarakara, Punalur, Paravur and Karunagapally.\nKollam is an ancient trading town \u2013 trading with Romans, Chinese, Arabs and other Orientals \u2013 mentioned in historical citations dating back to Biblical times and the reign of Solomon, connecting with Red Sea ports of the Arabian Sea (supported by a find of ancient Roman coins). There was also internal trade through the Punalur Pass connecting the ancient town to Tamil Nadu. The overland trade in pepper by bullock cart and the trade over the waterways connecting Allepey and Cochin established trade linkages that enabled it to grow into one of the earliest Indian industrial townships. The rail links later established to Tamil Nadu supported still stronger trade links. The factories processing marine exports and the processing and packaging of cashewnuts extended its trade across the globe.\nKollam is the fourth most populous city in Kerala(the new population is taken as city agglomeration) and the fifth largest in incorporated area. It is known for cashew processing and coir manufacturing. Ashtamudi Lake is considered the southern gateway to the backwaters of Kerala and is a prominent tourist destination at Kollam. The Kollam urban area includes suburban towns such as Paravur in the south, Kundara in the east and Karunagapally in the north of the city. Other important towns in the city suburbs are Eravipuram, Kottiyam, Kannanallur and Chavara.\nKollam appeared as Palombe in Mandeville's Travels, where he claimed it contained a Fountain of Youth. During the later stages of the rule of the Chera monarchy in Kerala, Kollam emerged as the focal point of trade and politics. Kollam continues to be a major business and commercial centre in the Southern Kerala.\nIn 825 CE, the Malayalam calendar, or Kollavarsham, was created in Kollam at meetings held in the city. The present Malayalam calendar is said to have begun with the re-founding of the town, which was rebuilt after its destruction by a fire. The name Kollam is believed to have been derived from the Sanskrit word Kollam, meaning pepper.\nAs the ancient city of Quilon, Kollam was a flourishing port during the Chera dynasty (c. 3rd century BC\u201312th century), and later became the capital of the independent Venad or Kingdom of Quilon on its foundation in c. 825. Kollam was considered one of the four early entrepots in global sea trade during the 13th century, along with Alexandria and Cairo in Egypt, the Chinese city of Quanzhou, and Malacca in the Malaysian archipelago\nAlong with Pattanam (Muziris), Quilon was an ancient seaport on the Malabar Coast of India from the early centuries before the Christian era. The city had a high commercial reputation from the days of the Phoenicians and Ancient Romans. Pliny the Elder (23\u201379 AD) mentions Greek ships anchored at Muziris and Nelcynda. There was also a land route over the Western Ghats. Spices, pearls, diamonds, and silk were exported to Egypt and Rome from these ports. Pearls and diamonds came to the Chera Kingdom from Ceylon and the southeastern coast of India, then known as the Pandyan Kingdom. Cosmas Indicopleustes, a Greek Nestorian sailor, in his book the Christian Topography who visited the Malabar coast in 550, mentions an enclave of Christian believers in Male (Chera Kingdom). He writes, \"In the island of Tabropane (Ceylon), there is a church of Christians, and clerics and faithful. Likewise at Male, where the pepper grows, and in the farming community of Kalliana (Kalliankal at Nillackal) there is also a bishop consecrated in Persia in accordance with the Nicea sunnahadose of 325 AD.\" The Nestorian Patriarch Jesujabus, who died in 660 AD, mentions Kollam in his letter to Simon, Metropolitan of Persia.\nThe port at Kollam, then known as Quilon, was founded in 825 by the Nestorian Christians Mar Sabor and Mar Proth with sanction from Ayyanadikal Thiruvadikal, the king of the independent Venad or State of Quilon, a feudatory under the Chera kingdom.\nIt is believed that Mar Sapor Iso also proposed that the Chera king create a new seaport near Kollam in lieu of his request that he rebuild the almost vanished inland seaport at Kollam (kore-ke-ni) near Backare (Thevalakara), also known as Nelcynda and Tyndis to the Romans and Greeks and as Thondi to the Tamils, which had been without trade for several centuries because the Cheras were overrun by the Pallavas in the 6th century, ending the spice trade from the Malabar coast. This allowed the Nestorinas to stay in the Chera kingdom for several decades and introduce the Christian faith among the Nampoothiri Vaishnavites and Nair sub castes in the St. Thomas tradition, with the Syrian liturgy as a basis for the Doctrine of the Trinity, without replacing the Sanskrit and Vedic prayers. The Tharisapalli plates presented to Maruvan Sapor Iso by Ayyanadikal Thiruvadikal granted the Christians the privilege of overseeing foreign trade in the city as well as control over its weights and measures in a move designed to increase Quilon's trade and wealth. The two Christians were also instrumental in founding Christian churches with Syrian liturgy along the Malabar coast, distinct from the ancient Vedic Shivism propounded by Adi Shankara in the early 9th century among the Nampoothiri Vaishnavites and Nair Sub Castes, as Malayalam was not accepted as a liturgical language until the early 18th century.\nThus began the Malayalam Era, known as Kolla Varsham after the city, indicating the importance of Kollam in the 9th century. The Persian merchant Soleyman of Siraf visited Malabar in the 9th century and found Quilon to be the only port in India used by the huge Chinese ships as their transhipment hub for goods on their way from China to the Persian Gulf. The rulers of Kollam (formerly called 'Desinganadu') had trade relations with China and exchanged embassies. According to the records of the Tang dynasty (618\u2013913), Quilon was their chief port of call before the 7th century. The Chinese trade decreased about 600 and was again revived in the 13th century. Mirabilia Descripta by Bishop Catalani gives a description of life in Kollam, which he saw as the Catholic bishop-designate to Kollam, the oldest Catholic diocese in India. He also gives true and imaginary descriptions of life in 'India the Major' in the period before Marco Polo visited the city.\nThe Portuguese were the first Europeans to establish a trading center in Tangasseri, Kollam in 1502, which became the centre of their trade in pepper. In the wars with the Moors/Arabs that followed, the ancient church (temple) of St Thomas Tradition at Thevalakara was destroyed. In 1517 the Portuguese built the St. Thomas Fort in Thangasseri, which was destroyed in the subsequent wars with the Dutch. In 1661 the Dutch East India Company took possession of the city. The remnants of the old Portuguese Fort, later renovated by the Dutch, can be found at Thangasseri. In the 18th century Travancore conquered Kollam, followed by the British in 1795. Thangasseri remains today as an Anglo-Indian settlement, though few Anglo-Indians remain. The Infant Jesus Church in Thangasseri, an old Portuguese-built church, remains as a memento of the Portuguese rule of the area.\nThe Battle of Quilon was fought in 1809 between a troop of the Indian kingdom of Travancore led by the then Dalawa (prime minister) of Travancore, Velu Thampi Dalawa and the British East India Company led by Colonel Chalmers at Cantonment Maidan in Quilon. The battle lasted for only six hours and was the result of the East India Company's invasion of Quilon and their garrison situated near the Cantonment Maidan. The company forces won the battle while all the insurrectionist who participated in the war were court-martialed and subsequently hanged at the maidan.\nExcavations are going on at Kollam Port premises since February 2014 as the team has uncovered arrays of antique artifacts, including Chinese porcelain and coins. A Chinese team with the Palace Museum, a team from India with Kerala Council for Historical Research (KCHR) are jointly working at the Kollam Port site for the treasure hunt. The archaeologists and historians said that the discovered coins and artifacts had the potential to tell the story of a bygone India-China link, and even strong trade links of Kollam city with other ancient empires.\nKollam city is bordered by the panchayats of Neendakara and Thrikkaruva to the north, Mayyanad to the south, and Thrikkovilvattom and Kottamkara to the east, and by the Laccadive Sea to the west.

population density of 34 persons per km\u00b2 in 10,089 households. The total area is . T\u014dno is known as \"The City of Folklore\" for its rural nature, its preservation of traditional culture and especially for the collection of folktales, T\u014dno Monogatari, written by Kunio Yanagita in 1910.\n", "text": "T\u014dno is located in central Iwate Prefecture, in the floodplain of the Sarugaishi River, surrounded by a ring of mountains. Mount Hayachine sits at the northernmost point of the city where Hanamaki, Kawai and T\u014dno meet. At 1,914 meters it is also the city's highest point. Mt. Rokkoushi, (1,294 meters) dominates the landscape to the east and Mt. Ishigami (1,038 meters) is the highest mountain in the west. Together these peaks form T\u014dno's \"big three\" mountains. The highest points in southern T\u014dno are Mt. Sadato (884 meters) on the border of Sumida and Mt. Tane (871 meters) on the borders of Sumita and \u014csh\u016b.\nAccordingly, to legend, in the past the hills in Miyamori blocked the Sarugaishi River creating a large lake in the T\u014dno area. Miyamori itself is characterized by a series of valleys to the west of Mt. Ishigami that flow west into the Sarugaishi River just below the Tase Dam.\nT\u014dno has a humid climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) characterized by mild summers and cold winters. The average annual temperature in T\u014dno is 9.6 \u00b0C. The average annual rainfall is 1388 mm with September as the wettest month and February as the driest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 22.6 \u00b0C, and lowest in January, at around -2.2 \u00b0C.\nPer Japanese census data, the population of T\u014dno has declined over the past 40 years. Per official data from T\u014dno city hall, 37.6% of the population is over the age of 65.\nThe area of present-day T\u014dno was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the J\u014dmon period. Pottery fragments can still be found in farmers' fields and other places. Later the area was inhabited by the Emishi and many place names are based on the Ainu language. In the Early Nine-Years War lasting from 1051 to 1063, Minamoto no Yoshiie fought running battles with Abe no Sadato throughout the area. There are references to this in \"T\u014dno Monogatari\" and arrowheads still turn up from time to time.Later the Hiraizumi Fujiwara controlled T\u014dno which was a prized area for horse breeding, farming and hunting.\nDuring the Sengoku period, the area was dominated by various samurai clans before coming under the control of the Nambu clan during the Edo period, who ruled Morioka Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. The Nambu built Nabekura Castle in what is now known as Nabekura Park in downtown T\u014dno as a defence against the powerful Date clan of Sendai Domain to then south, and assigned to Nanbu Naoyoshi, formerly castellan of Ne Castle near Hachinohe in 1627. This formed an unofficial subsidiary 12,500 koku domain of Morioka Domain, which lasted until the Meiji restoration.\nWith the Meiji period establishment of the modern municipalities system, the town of T\u014dno was established on April 1, 1889 within Nishihei District of Iwate Prefecture. In 1896, Nishihei and Minamihei districts were merged to form Kamihei District. During the Meiji period, T\u014dno developed a silk and cotton weaving industry dependent on Morioka. The silk industry was destroyed by intensely cold weather during the winter of 1905-06. The residents of T\u014dno were reduced to eating wild roots by the famine of this period and many died or moved away.\nThe modern city of T\u014dno was officially founded on December 1, 1954 by the merger of the former town of T\u014dno with the seven villages of Ayaori, Otomo, Tsukimoushi, Matsuzaki, Tsuchibuchi, Aozasa and Kamigo.\nOn October 1, 2005, the village of Miyamori (from Kamihei District) was merged into T\u014dno to bring the city to its present boundaries.\nT\u014dno has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of eighteen members.\nThere are two senior high schools in T\u014dno, under the purview of Iwate's Prefectural Board of Education. Iwate Prefectural T\u014dno Senior High School offers an academic curriculum, while Iwate Prefectural T\u014dno Ryokuh\u014d Senior High School is vocational.\nThe T\u014dno city board of education operates three junior high schools: T\u014dno, T\u014dno-Higashi, and T\u014dno-Nishi, and 11 elementary schools: Aozasa, Ayaori, Kamig\u014d, Masuzawa, Miyamori, Otomo, Tassobe, T\u014dno, T\u014dno North, Tsuchibuchi, and Tsukimoushi.\nThe city has a number of sightseeing spots, such as Kappabuchi, a pool where the mythical creatures called kappa are said to live. T\u014dno Furusato Village preserves several magariya, or L-shaped houses, from the 18th and 19th centuries. The Chiba Family House is another large magariya that is preserved in T\u014dno as a museum.\nT\u014dno's food includes Genghis Khan or barbecued lamb and hittsumi or wheat dumplings as well as horse meat. The Miyamori part of T\u014dno is known for its wasabi production and a local brewery makes a wasabi beer.\nFestivals include the T\u014dno Folktales Festival in early February, in which local storytellers recite stories from the T\u014dno Monogatari. The T\u014dno Tanabata Festival is held in early August and features a parade of dancers through the city center. In mid-September is the T\u014dno Festival which also features a parade and yabusame or horseback archery.\nT\u014dno is known throughout Japan as the cradle of T\u014dno Monogatari (Tales of T\u014dno) , written in 1910 by Kunio Yanagita, who gathered folk tales of the area. This book is now considered one of the greatest studies of Japanese folklore , and inspired the 1982 movie of the same name.\nSeveral of these tales involve the Kappa, mischievous water sprites. A legendary location in T\u014dno is the Kappa-buchi, a water stream where kappas are said to live.\nThe mascot of the city, Karin-chan, is a cute kappa holding a bellflower. She is usually depicted walking in front of a magariya.\nT\u014dno is also twinned with three Japanese cities:\n- Mitaka, Tokyo, since 1989\n- Musashino, Tokyo, since 1988\n- Kikuchi, Kumamoto, since 1998\nFrom 1990 to 2010, the high schools of T\u014dno and the Chattanooga School for the Arts & Sciences (CSAS) in Chattanooga, Tennessee were paired by School Partners Abroad to establish an exchange program. Near the end of every Japanese school year (in March), a delegation of T\u014dno high-school students visited Chattanooga, and reciprocally, a delegation from CSAS visited T\u014dno every summer. The city of T\u014dno embraced this exchange and organized a delegation of junior high school students to visit CSAS and the Chattanooga School for the Liberal Arts (CSLA) a few weeks before the high school students.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 889, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 889, "length": 357, "sectionHeading": "Geography | Climate", "sectionLabel": "city.climate"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1246, "length": 172, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1418, "length": 2093, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3511, "length": 129, "sectionHeading": "Government", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3640, "length": 488, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4128, "length": 877, "sectionHeading": "Local attractions | Overview", "sectionLabel": "city.overview"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5005, "length": 573, "sectionHeading": "Local attractions | Folklore", "sectionLabel": "city.tourism"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5578, "length": 738, "sectionHeading": "International relations", "sectionLabel": "city.international_affairs"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globe,_Arizona", "type": "city", "title": "Globe, Arizona", "abstract": "Globe ( , \"place of metal\") is a city in Gila County, Arizona, United States.

The average household size was 2.49 and the average family size was 3.09.\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 25.8% under the age of 18, 7.6% from 18 to 24, 26.5% from 25 to 44, 24.4% from 45 to 64, and 15.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females there were 101.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 100.1 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $33,071, and the median income for a family was $42,280. Males had a median income of $31,404 versus $21,952 for females. The per capita income for the city was $16,128. About 8.8% of families and 11.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 14.8% of those under age 18 and 8.4% of those age 65 or over.\nIn 1875, prospectors found silver in the San Carlos Apache Reservation, including an unusual globe-shaped silver nugget. In just four years, the silver began to give out, but by then copper deposits were discovered. In the 1900s, the Old Dominion Copper Company in Globe ranked as one of the world's richest. The Old Dominion closed in 1931, and mining operations moved to nearby Miami.\nGlobe's economy remains heavily dependent on the mining industry, and as of 2008 the city was home to one of the few operating copper smelters in the United States.\nBesh-Ba-Gowah, about one mile south of Globe, was occupied by Salado populations between AD 1225 and AD 1400.\nThe plans for an incorporated Globe were established in July 1876, with retail stores, banks, and Globe's first newspaper printing its first issue on May 2, 1878. By February 1881, Globe was the Gila County seat. Coming with Globe's new importance as the county seat came a stagecoach line linking it to Silver City, New Mexico.\nDue to Globe's relative isolation from the rest of Arizona and its proximity to the San Carlos Apache reservation, Globe remained a frontier town. Globe's history is laced with many historic events such as murders, stagecoach robberies, outlaws, lynchings, and Apache raids. Natiotish, a San Carlos Apache, left the reservation with a group of about 50 men and continued to attack ranchers and miners.\nIn 1884 the surviving Clanton brothers Ike and Phineas arrived in Apache County after the infamous gunfight at the OK Corral in Tombstone. Ike was eventually killed by a local deputy sheriff, and Phineas, after serving prison time for a stage robbery, moved to Globe, where he died of pneumonia and was buried in 1906.\nGlobe is also known for having links to Geronimo and the Apache Kid. On October 23, 1889, the Apache Kid's trial was held in the Globe Courthouse. After he was convicted, it was the responsibility of Sheriff Glenn Reynolds to transport him to the Arizona Territorial Prison in Yuma. Sheriff Reynolds, his deputy, and their prisoners set out in an armored stagecoach holding the Apache Kid inside. At an incline in the road, known as the Kelvin Grade, near present-day Kearny, Sheriff Reynolds let some of the prisoners out of the stagecoach seeing as they were on an uphill climb and he wanted to ease the burden on the horses. The prisoners were able to overcome and murder Sheriff Reynolds as well as one other man. A third was left for dead.

Subsequently, O'Neil, who originally owned a fourth of the section of the township, purchased the interests of McConnell and Swearingen, and retained sole ownership of the land. The 1890 census showed 357 inhabitants across the county, with 89 ranches and farms and of land in cultivation. In August 1890, a petition was circulated to organize the county, choose a county seat, and elect county officers. Two potential townships were proposed: Wellington and Pearl. The proposed town of Wellington was located on the land owned by Ernest T. O'Neil who was promoting this location, and had been given its proposed name by his wife, Matilda Anna Elisabeth \"Lizzie\" O'Neil, who greatly admired the Duke of Wellington, hero of the Battle of Waterloo. The alternate and proposed town of Pearl was located several miles north of Wellington.\nIn September 1890, the vote was held and Wellington was selected for the seat of the newly organized county of Collingsworth. In 1891 the new city, laid out by Ernest T. O'Neil, was surveyed and platted, and the first postal service and postmaster, Carrie M. Barton, was established on January 9, 1891. Construction of a courthouse began in 1893, and the contractor, J. A. White, built the courthouse of locally made bricks. With the extra materials left over from the courthouse, J. A. White erected a mercantile store for Ernest T. O'Neil. This became the first mercantile store and commercial building in Wellington, prior to the opening of a two-story hotel by O'Neil. Later O'Neil organized the first bank, was active in all phases of the county's growth and development, and served as postmaster from August 22, 1895 to December 11, 1897.\nEarly in the early 20th century, Wellington was connected with Wichita Falls through the Wichita Falls and Wellington Railroad, one of the properties of the industrialist Joseph A. Kemp of Wichita Falls.

The change of name from 0'possum to Ila has been dated to circa 1882-1883. During the 1880s, Dr. George W. Westbrook joined them and the area grew into a small community.

The Timucua traded with other Native American tribes in the area until the arrival of P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez in 1528. De Narv\u00e1ez decimated the indigenous people before leaving the area in search of gold.\nTreasure Island got its name early in the 20th century, after several property owners attempted to boost sales of the properties being developed on the island by first burying and then pretending to discover a couple of wooden chests on the beach around 1915. After claiming the chests were filled with treasure, the news of the discovery quickly spread and people began calling the island Treasure Island.\nWith an elevation of only three feet, the Great Gale of 1848 carved out John's Pass on the island's north end and split off two smaller islands, called the Isle of Palms and Isle of Capri.\nTreasure Island saw a surge in residential and hotel construction following World War II through the 1950s. The real estate used in these ventures often consisted of fill from dredged material; that is, artificial extensions of the land were created, which were usually designed for convenient access to navigable waterways.\nLegendary baseball slugger Babe Ruth had a winter beachfront home on Treasure Island after his retirement.\nTreasure Island today has a thriving bar and restaurant scene in its downtown.\nTreasure Island has a humid subtropical climate, closely bordering a tropical climate, resulting in warm, humid summers with frequent thunderstorms, and drier winters.\nThe community is served by the Gulf Beaches Public Library, located in nearby Madeira Beach.

The city is also home to Stuart Hall, a private co-ed preparatory school, as well as the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind.\n", "text": "The area was first settled in 1732 by John Lewis and family. In 1736, William Beverley, a wealthy planter and merchant from Essex County, was granted by the Crown over in what would become Augusta County. Surveyor Thomas Lewis in 1746 laid out the first town plat for Beverley of what was originally called Beverley's Mill Place. Founded in 1747, it was renamed in honor of Lady Rebecca Staunton, wife to Royal Lieutenant-Governor Sir William Gooch. Because the town was located at the geographical center of the colony (which then included West Virginia), Staunton served between 1738 and 1771 as regional capital for what was known as the Northwest Territory, with the westernmost courthouse in British North America prior to the Revolution. By 1760, Staunton was one of the major \"remote trading centers in the backcountry\" which coordinated the transportation of the vast amounts of grain and tobacco then being produced in response to the change of Britain from a net exporter of produce to an importer. Staunton thus played a crucial role in the mid 18th century expansion of the economies of the American Colonies which, in turn, contributed to the success of the American Revolution. It served as capital of Virginia in June 1781, when state legislators fled Richmond and then Charlottesville to avoid capture by the British.\nLike most of colonial America, slavery was present in Staunton. For instance, in 1815, a slave named Henry ran away from John G. Wright's Staunton plantation. Wright placed an ad in the Daily National Intelligencer in Washington, D.C. seeking Henry's return. It notes that Henry was an excellent cook and was widely travelled, having been as far as the West Indies.\nIn August 1855, President Franklin Pierce visited Staunton. He gave a speech at the Virginia Hotel, in which he stated that his \"feelings revolted from the idea of a dissolution of the union.\" He said that \"[i]t would be the Iliad of innumerable woes, from the contemplation of which he shrank.\"\nLocated along the Valley Pike, Staunton developed as a trade, transportation and industrial center, particularly after the Virginia Central Railroad arrived in 1854. Factories made carriages, wagons, boots and shoes, clothing and blankets. In 1860, the Staunton Military Academy was founded. By 1860, Staunton had at least one pro-union, pro-slavery (the Staunton Spectator) and at least one pro-secession, pro-slavery newspaper (the Staunton Vindicator). The Spectator ran editorials before the war urging its citizens to vote for union, while the Vindicator ran, e.g., stories reporting on \"unruly\" slaves mutilating themselves to escape being sold.\nOn May 23, 1861, shortly after the firing on Fort Sumter began the American Civil War, Virginians voted on whether to ratify articles of secession from the Union and join the Confederate States. The articles were overwhelmingly approved throughout the Commonwealth, even in the majority of the counties that would later become West Virginia. The vote in Stanton was 3300 in favor of secession, with only 6 opposed. During the war, the town became an important Shenandoah Valley manufacturing center, a staging area, and a supply depot for the Confederacy. On May 2, 1862, Union General John C. Fr\u00e9mont occupied Staunton while on his way to a rendezvous with General Nathaniel P. Banks to pursue Stonewall Jackson's forces. They met at the Battle of Cross Keys, fought near Harrisonburg, Virginia on June 6\u20137, 1862. By October 1862 Staunton was back in Confederate hands, occupied by the 2nd South Carolina infantry.\nOn June 6, 1864, Union Major General David Hunter arrived with 10,000 troops to cut supply, communication and railway lines useful to the Confederacy. The next day, they destroyed the railroad station, warehouses, houses, factories and mills. Union soldiers looted the stores and warehouses and confiscated supplies.\nOn July 10, 1902, Staunton became an independent city.\nIn 1908, Staunton created the city manager form of government. Charles E. Ashburner was hired by Staunton as the nation's first city manager.\nStaunton is also home to the former Western State Asylum, a hospital for the mentally ill, which originally began operations in 1828. The hospital was renamed Western State Hospital in 1894.\nIn its early days, the facility was a resort-style asylum. It had terraced gardens where patients could plant flowers and take walks, roof walks to provide mountain views, and many architectural details to create an atmosphere that would aid in the healing process. However, by the mid 19th Century, this utopian model of care had vanished, replaced by overcrowding in the facility and the warehousing of patients. Techniques such as \"ankle and wrist restraints, physical coercion, and straitjackets\" were used. After the passage of the Eugenical Sterilization Act of 1924 in Virginia, patients were forcibly sterilized at Western State until the law authorizing the practice was repealed in the 1970s. Later, electroshock therapy and lobotomies were practiced at the facility.\nWhen Western State vacated the property and moved its adult patients to its present site near Interstate 81, the facility was renamed the Staunton Correctional Center and turned into a medium-security men's penitentiary. The prison closed in 2003, and the site was left vacant for several years. In 2005, the state of Virginia gave the original property to the Staunton Industrial Authority. It is now a condominium complex called The Villages at Staunton.\nA separate complex, The DeJarnette State Sanatoruim, was constructed in 1932 and acted as a location for patients with the ability to pay for their treatment. Dr. DeJarnette was the superintendent of the sanatorium from its opening until his retirement in 1947.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , virtually all of which is land. Staunton is located in the Shenandoah Valley in between the Blue Ridge and Allegheny Mountains of the Appalachian Mountains. It is drained by Lewis Creek. Lewis Creek flows into the Shenandoah River, which flows into the Potomac, and eventually to the Chesapeake Bay.\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification system, Staunton has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \"Cfa\" on climate maps.\nStaunton operates under a council-manager form of government. In 1908, Staunton was the first city in the United States to give an appointed employee authority over city affairs through statute. In 1912, Sumter, S.C., was the first U.S. city to implement the council-manager form of city government. The city of Staunton refers to itself on its website as the \"birthplace of President Woodrow Wilson, and the city manager form of government.\"\nStaunton is part of Virginia's 6th congressional district.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 23,853 people, 9,676 households, and 5,766 families residing in the city.

The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females there were 89.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.0 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $32,941, and the median income for a family was $44,422. Males had a median income of $30,153 versus $22,079 for females. The per capita income for the city was $19,161. About 7.7% of families and 11.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 15.9% of those under age 18 and 10.7% of those age 65 or over.\nAs of 2008, Staunton was suffering one of Virginia's \"most severe population declines\", with the immigration rate and the birth rate failing to make up for the emigration rate and the death rate. The population declined almost 4% between 2000 and 2007, according to a study done by Charles Spar of the University of Virginia.\nIn 2011, Tim Heaphy, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia stated that Staunton, along with other small cities in his district, had \"pockets of ... gang and drug activity.\" As late as 2006, the city had an active set of the Bloods. According to Augusta County Sheriff Randy Fisher, the Bloods, Crips, Latin Kings and MS-13 are active in the area.\nAccording to Staunton's 2015 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:\nStaunton is home to the American Shakespeare Center, a theatrical company centered at the Blackfriars Playhouse, a replica of Shakespeare's Blackfriars Theatre. In 2012, it also became the home of the Heifetz International Music Institute, named for renowned violinist Daniel Heifetz, a summer music school and festival dedicated to the artistic growth and career development of some of the world\u2019s most talented and promising classical musicians. The Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library is open for visitors, as well as the Museum of American Frontier Culture, which provides insight into life in early America.\nThe Staunton Music Festival \u2013 celebrating its 20th year in 2017 \u2013 features multiple concerts each day, with programs of music from the Renaissance to the present. The festival takes place during the early part of August annually. All performances take place at historic venues in downtown Staunton.\nStaunton is also the center of numerous galleries and art schools, including The Dwell Collective and the widely regarded Beverley Street Studio School, and its associated Co-Art Gallery. In addition Staunton is home to the Hypnagogia Film Collective, a collection of avant-garde experimental filmmakers.\nStaunton is home to the Statler Brothers, country music legends who until 1994 performed free concerts at the annual Fourth of July celebration, accompanied by other country music artists. Statler Brothers members Don Reid, Harold Reid, and Phil Balsley grew up and still reside in the city. Lew DeWitt was also a notable member of the Statlers who grew up in Staunton, VA.\nFolksinger Phil Ochs attended Staunton Military Academy between 1956 and 1958, where he played clarinet in the marching band. His exposure to the country music played on local radio, quite different from what he was used to hearing in his home state of Ohio, was a significant influence on his decision to become a singer.\nDowntown Staunton and Sherwood Avenue were used in the American Civil War film Gods and Generals. The local Shenandoah Valley Railroad as well as a number of nearby houses were used in filming of Hearts in Atlantis. In 1993, a portion of the Showtime production of was filmed here. In the summer of 2006, some scenes for the movie Evan Almighty were also filmed in Staunton. Some scenes for Familiar Strangers were also filmed in Staunton in 2007.\nStaunton is home to nearly 200 buildings designed by architect Thomas Jasper Collins (1844\u20131925), who worked in various styles during the Victorian era. His firm, T. J. Collins & Sons, is still in business.\nThe city was once home to about ten hotels, but only one of them is still in operation - the Stonewall Jackson Hotel. This hotel was renovated in the early 2000s, and is now in operation as both a hotel and a conference center. The Ingleside Resort is also still in operation. During World War II it was used by the INS as a detention center for enemy aliens held under Executive Order 9066. Some of the hotels that are no longer in operation are The Virginia Hotel, the Eakleton Hotel, the Valley Hotel, the American Hotel and the Hotel Beverley. All of these buildings are still standing except for the Virginia Hotel, which was demolished in 1930 to make way for a planned addition to the Stonewall Jackson Hotel which was never built. The New Street Parking Garage now stands on the site. Among the houses in Staunton on the National Register of Historic Places is The Oaks, at 437 East Beverley Street. An 1840s structure, it was modified and enlarged in 1888 by famed Civil War cartographer Jedediah Hotchkiss. Also on the National Register is \"Waverley Hill\", a Georgian revival house designed in 1929 by renowned architect William Bottomley with a landscape designed by Arthur Shurcliff.\nIn 1894, Staunton fielded a baseball team in the original Virginia League: The Hayseeds. In 1914, the city fielded a team in the Virginia Mountain League: The Staunton Lunatics. The Lunatics moved to Harrisonburg in July 1914, just before the league disbanded. From 1939 to 1942, the city fielded a team in the second Virginia League: the Staunton Presidents. Staunton currently has no minor league baseball, but the Staunton Braves represent the city in the Valley Baseball League, a collegiate summer baseball league that plays in the Shenandoah Valley.\nStaunton is served by Amtrak's Cardinal. The train station, which is located downtown, is the closest station to the nearby cities of Harrisonburg and Lexington. The Buckingham Branch\nalso has a small railyard.\nStaunton had a municipal bus system during the 20th century, known as the Staunton Transit Service, but it was dissolved in 1989. In 1944, World War II veteran S. Melvin Johnson wrote to Truman Gibson, assistant to William H. Hastie, advisor to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, regarding segregated seating on the Staunton Transit Service and stating that returning African-American soldiers would not stand for such conditions. This letter was an indication of the role that African-American veterans would later play in the American civil rights movement. In 1946, after the United States Supreme Court decision Irene Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia, which found that Virginia's segregated seating law was unconstitutional with respect to interstate bus routes, Ethel New, a black woman from Lynch, Kentucky, was arrested for violating the law because she had purchased an intrastate ticket. New suffered a miscarriage subsequent to her arrest and sued Greyhound Lines and the arresting officer in Staunton. In September 1947, meeting in Staunton, the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals upheld the all-white jury's verdict exonerating both the bus line and the officer.\nBRITE Bus Transit Services provides fixed-route transit bus service in Staunton on three routes: the Downtown Trolley, West Route, and North Route. The Coordinated Area Transportation Services (CATS) operates a demand-response service throughout the Staunton area, as well as a fixed shuttle service between the downtown areas of Staunton and Waynesboro.\nThe city is adjacent to the northernmost junction of I-81 and I-64. Virginia State Route 262 forms a partial beltway around the city, and both US 250 and US 11 pass through the city.\nThe nearest commercial airport is Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport in Weyers Cave, Virginia.\nStaunton City Schools is the school district of the city.\nBlack Virginians were largely barred from education until Reconstruction. The first school in Staunton which allowed African-Americans to attend was established by the Freedmen's Bureau under the supervision of the commanding general of the occupying Union army in late 1865. Arrangements were made to bring in women from the North as teachers, and the jury rooms of the Augusta County Courthouse, located at 1 E. Johnson Street, were to be used as classrooms. The court protested this plan, however, and it is possible that another location was found.\nIn 1964 the Staunton chapter of the NAACP threatened the city with a lawsuit if they did not immediately desegregate the public schools. The City School Board, headed by Thomas W. Dixon, declined to take further action, contending that the schools were already desegregated as ten black children had been allowed to attend previously all-white schools. Attorneys for the city of Staunton submitted a plan for the desegregation of its public schools in 1965 by eliminating all negro schools in time for the 1967-68 school year, which was approved by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. However, the implementation of this plan was delayed to such an extent that a group of African-American parents brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia against the city. This case, Bell v. School Board of Staunton, was decided on January 5, 1966, with the court stating that the delay was a violation of the rights of the students under the Fourteenth Amendment and ordering that the schools and their faculty be desegregated in time for the 1966-67 school year.\nThe Staunton city school district is one of 21 in Virginia which take elementary school students out of class for Bible lessons on a voluntary basis, a practice known as Weekday Religious Education. Although the U.S. Supreme Court ended taxpayer funded religious education in 1948 in McCollum v.

It served as the state capital of Illinois from 1819 until 1839, when the seat of state government moved to Springfield (which remains the capital today).

The previous capital, Kaskaskia, was unsuitable because it was under the constant threat of flooding. The townsite was hastily prepared for the 1820 meeting of the Illinois General Assembly.\nThe history of the name Vandalia is uncertain. Different theories can be found in almost all of the books written about Vandalia over the years. In her book Vandalia: Wilderness Capital of Lincoln's Land, Mary Burtschi tells of a conversation between one of the original surveyors of the town and a Vandalia resident. The surveyor, Colonel Greenup, explained that Van was suggested by one of the men. He recommended this as an abbreviation to the word vanguard meaning the forefront of an advancing movement. Another suggestion was made for the term dalia, derived from the Anglo-Saxon word dale which means a valley between hills. Greenup takes credit in the conversation for connecting the two terms to form the name Vandalia.\nAnother possible source of the name is the Vandalia colony, a failed attempt to establish a fourteenth colony in part of what is now West Virginia and Ohio. The Vandalia colony was named in honor of Queen Charlotte, who claimed descent from the Wendish tribe of Obodrites, also called the Vandals.\nAnother theory put forth is that Vandalia was named by those who located the state capital in the town; according to the story, they mistakenly thought the Vandals were a brave Native American tribe, rather than of Germanic origins.\nThe law under which Vandalia was founded included a provision that the capital would not be moved for twenty years. Even before the end of this period, the population center of the state had shifted far north of Vandalia. In 1837, the General Assembly voted to move the capital to Springfield.\nOn November 21, 1915, the Liberty Bell passed through Vandalia on its nationwide tour, while being returned to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco.\nIn the early 1960s the sociologist Joseph Lyford examined the social structure of Vandalia in a book-length study that revealed the essentially corporatist nature of decision-making in the city; this work was recently revisited by the Economist newspaper.\nIn 1900, 2,665 people lived in Vandalia; in 1910, 2,974; and in 1940, 5,288.

The large nearby reservoir, West Point Lake, was created by the Army Corps of Engineers by the building of the West Point Dam, for water storage and hydroelectric power generation. The reservoir stores water which can be released during dry seasons, in order to maintain the water level of the navigable inland waterway from Columbus, Georgia, south to the Gulf of Mexico.\nDuring the late spring of 2003, there was a flood caused by extremely heavy rainfall and thunderstorms upstream of the West Point Dam; the weather caused the water level in the reservoir to come close to overflowing the top of the dam. There were allegations of poor forecasting by the Corps of Engineers of the reservoir's water levels. The flood water would have overflowed the dam had a large amount of water not been released though the spillway of the dam. Whereas this prevented the catastrophic failure of the West Point Dam, the city endured a flood much more severe than any other in the time since the dam had been built.\nIn the mid-19th century, the Atlanta & LaGrange Railroad was established and soon renamed the Atlanta & West Point Railroad, using the name of West Point; the city of East Point, Fulton County, Georgia, received its name for being at the northeastern end of this railroad line.

Duisburg therefore could mean \"fortified place in the floodplain\". Another interpretation assumes that the name is derived from the Old German \"duis\" which means \"hill\". Duisburg could mean something like \"castle on the hill\". Thus, a place on a hill overlooking the Rhine, that could refer to the area of the present Town Hall. Duisburggau (Diuspurgau) was also the name of the medieval Gau (country subdivision) on the Lower Rhine.\nA legend recorded by Johannes Aventinus (fl. 1525) holds that Duisburg, (along with Deutz, Cologne, Duisdorf in Bonn, and Doesburg in the Netherlands, all on the Rhine's right bank) was built by the namesake Tuisto, mythical progenitor of Germans, ca. 2395 BC. There is nothing to establish any historical basis for such an early founding of Duisburg, which would have made it among the earliest cities in Europe.\nLatest archaeological studies show that the present-day market-place was already in use in the first century. It has been the major central trading place of the city since the 5th century. The city itself was located at the \"Hellweg\", an important medieval trade route, and at a ford across the Rhine. The Romans already guarded the ford.\n- 420: The Franks usurp the Roman settlement and recolonize the old part of the town.\n- 883: The Normans conquer Duisburg and stay for the winter. First historic document mentioning Duisburg.\nDue to the town's favorable geographic position a palatinate was built and the town was soon granted the royal charter of a free city. Duisburg became a member of the Hanseatic League. Around 1000 the river Rhine moved westward from the city. This put an end to the city's development as a trading town and it soon grew into a quiet rural city.\nThe productions of cartographer Gerardus Mercator and the foundation of a university in 1655 established the city's renown as \"Educated Duisburg\" (\"Duisburgum Doctum\").\n- 1120: construction of the city wall\n- 1279: \"city charter\" granted by King Lothar III\n- 1290 Duisburg becomes part of the County (after 1417 Duchy) of Cleves\n- 1445 attack by Archbishop-Elector Dietrich II von Moers () of Cologne was thwarted\n- 1566 Johannes Corputius completes his city map of Duisburg.\n- 1666 Duisburg within the Duchy of Cleves becomes a part of Brandenburg-Prussia\nThe rise of tobacco and textile industries in the 18th century made Duisburg an industrial center.

As such, it is considered by some historians to be the single most heavily bombed German city by the Allies during World War II, with industrial areas and residential blocks targeted by Allied incendiary bombs.\nOn the night of 12\u201313 June 1941, British bombers dropped a total of 445 tons of bombs in and around Duisburg. As part of the Battle of the Ruhr, another British raid of 577 bombers destroyed the old city between 12\u201313 May 1943 with 1,599 tons of bombs. During the bombing raids, 96,000 people were made homeless with countless lives lost.\nIn 1944 the city was again badly damaged as a total of 2,000 tons of bombs were dropped on 22 May. On 14 October, the tonnage was repeated with 2,018 tons when Halifax, Lancaster, and Mosquito bombers appeared over Duisburg as part of Operation Hurricane. This daylight raid was followed by a night attack; over 24 hours about 9,000 tons of HE and incendiaries had been dropped on Duisburg. Numerous similar attacks followed until the end of 1944.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Duisburg in April 1945. The US 17th Airborne Division, acting as regular infantry and not in a parachute role, met only scattered resistance in the vicinity and captured the city on 12 April 1945.\nOn 8 May 1945 the ADSEC Engineer Group A, led by Col. Helmer Swenholt, commanding officer of the 332nd Engineer General Service Regiment, constructed a railway bridge between Duisburg and Rheinhausen across the Rhine. It was 860 meters long, and constructed in six days, fifteen hours and twenty minutes, a record time. It was named the \"Victory Bridge\".\nA total of 299 bombing raids had almost completely destroyed the historic cityscape. 80% of all residential buildings had been destroyed or partly damaged. Almost the whole of the city had to be rebuilt, and most historic landmarks had been lost.\nBeginning in the mid-1960s, the decline of Duisburg's steel and mining industry caused a significant loss of residents. While in 1975 approximately 590,000 people were living in Duisburg, the number has shrunk to 518,000 in 1985.\nDuisburg celebrated its 1100th anniversary in 1983. The city's population recovered a little in the following years, up to 537,000 in 1992. It declined to 488,000 in 2011. On 19 July 2004, it was hit by a tornado. The municipal theater and parts of the city center were damaged. The city hosted the 7th World Games in 2005. In 2010, 21 people died because of a mass panic at the Love Parade; over 500 people were injured.\nIn 2007, evidence surfaced that linked a mosque in the city with the Hamburg cell, and also with ringleader Mohammed Atta. The police also uncovered calendars belonging to mosque parishioners, with the dates April 15, 2001 (the date when many hijackers slipped into the US to finalize preparations for the September 11 attacks) inscribed with 'The program begins' and September 11, 2001 inscribed with 'The program ends' in Arabic. Further investigation revealed that Guantanamo Bay inmate Mohamed Ould Slahi was a frequent visitor to the mosque, and had helped Atta recruit conspirators for the attacks. It was also believed that Ould Slahi was present in the city on September 10 discussing the attacks with other unidentified extremists. This evidence arose at around the same time as news broke of German Islamists being trained in Pakistani terrorist camps.\nIn 2010, the city had a population of 489,600. Hence, Duisburg has seen a slight decrease in its population since 2006.\nPopulation structure\nDuisburg is home to 85,000 people of Turkish origin. Other estimates suggest that the Turkish population is as many as 100,000 The new Merkez Mosque, one of the largest Muslim place of worship in Western Europe, was built with help by the way of contribution of 3.2 million euro from the EU and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.\nAsiye Nur Fettaho\u011flu, a Turkish-German actress was born in Duisburg on November 12, 1980.\n\"Duisport\" is the largest inland port in the world. It is officially regarded as a \"seaport\" because seagoing river vessels go to ports in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Numerous docks are mostly located at the mouth of the Ruhr where it joins the Rhine.\nEach year more than 40 million tonnes of various goods are handled with more than 20,000 ships calling at the port. The public harbor facilities stretch across an area of . There are 21 docks covering an area of and of wharf. The area of the Logport Logistic Center Duisburg stretches across an area of . With 2.5 million TEU it is also the largest inland container port based on 2011 figures. A number of companies run their own private docks and 114 million tonnes of goods yearly (2010) are handled in Duisburg in total.\nDuisburg is served by several autobahns, with 3 east\u2013west routes and 2 north\u2013south routes. A3 forms a bypass east of the city and mostly serves through traffic. A59 runs parallel to A3 and serves the city from north to south with 14 interchanges, much more than most other cities in the Ruhr area. The A40 and A42 are two east\u2013west routes that serve central and northern Duisburg. Autobahn A40 also serves major through traffic from the Netherlands to Berlin and points east. A short spur, A524 serves southern Duisburg. Most Autobahns have six lanes or are upgraded to six lanes (A59).\nApart from the autobahns, no Bundesstra\u00dfen serve the city directly. B8 runs through the city, but uses A59's alignment. B288 runs in the extreme south of the city, and serves traffic to and from Krefeld. Several bridges span the Rhine, most prominently the A40 and A42 bridges, but also the L287 suspension bridge and the L237 arch bridge, a three-lane bridge with 2 lanes per peak direction with dynamic lane usage.\nDuisburg Hbf is served by the InterCityExpress and InterCity long-distance network of the Deutsche Bahn, in addition lines S 1 and S 2 of the S-Bahn line connect Duisburg with other cities of the Rhine-Ruhr area.\nA Stadtbahn light rail line, the Duisburg tramway network, and a bus system, all operated by the Duisburger Verkehrsgesellschaft provide local services. Stadtbahn line U79, the so-called D-Bahn, is a connection to the neighbouring city of D\u00fcsseldorf and is operated jointly with the Rheinbahn of D\u00fcsseldorf. All S-Bahn, Stadtbahn and bus lines operate under the umbrella of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr\nThere are several newspapers reporting on local events and politics, including the \"Westdeutsche Allgemeine\" (WAZ), the \"Neue Ruhr Zeitung\" (NRZ) and the \"Rheinische Post\" (RP).\nThe local radio station \"Radio Duisburg\" was the first local radio broadcaster in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It started broadcasting in 1990.\nThere is a local television station (\"STUDIO 47\"), which was the first local station to broadcast in North Rhine-Westphalia. It started broadcasting in 2006.\nIn its Duisburg studios the WDR produces a local programme for the city of Duisburg and the Lower Rhine region north of D\u00fcsseldorf. WDR is part of the German television and radio network ARD.\nDuisburg hosts a comprehensive range of cultural facilities and events. A highlight is the annual \"Duisburger Akzente\", a festival focusing on modern social, political and cultural topics.\nBesides D\u00fcsseldorf Duisburg is a residence of the Deutsche Oper am Rhein, one of the major opera houses in Germany. The Duisburg Philharmonic Orchestra is one of Germany's orchestras with an international reputation.\nThanks to its history as a harbor city and a trade and industrial center Duisburg offers a variety of architectural places of interest, such as the German Inland Waterways Museum. The spectrum goes from old churches such as \"St Johann Baptist\" in Duisburg-Hamborn, which was built in 900, to modern age buildings like Micro-Electronic-Centrum in Duisburg-Neudorf, built in 1995.\nAnother subject of interest is the Landschaftspark Duisburg-Nord an abandoned industrial complex open to the public and an Anchor Point of ERIH, The European Route of Industrial Heritage.\nThe city center locates the Wilhelm Lehmbruck Museum, the municipal theatre and the shopping street known as \"fountain mile\".\nThe city also contains two botanical gardens, the Botanischer Garten Duisburg-Hamborn and the Botanischer Garten Kaiserberg, as well as a number of municipal parks.\nOn 24 July 2010, 21 people were killed and hundreds injured in the city during the Love Parade, an electronic music procession and party.\nDuisburg is involved in many kinds of sports. Nevertheless, most important for its inhabitants is the local football club MSV Duisburg. Recently, with the new MSV Arena the city received a brand new sports stadium for various kinds of sports such as football and American football.\nDuring the summer months of 2005 the World Games took place in Duisburg. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Duisburg was the stage for preparation of the Portuguese team and the residence of the Italian football team, who won the cup in the final match against France.\nDuisburg is also known for its Rhein-Ruhr-Marathon, its rowing and canoeing regattas and the world championships that take place there regularly. Other popular sports are icehockey, baseball, American football, water polo and hockey.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 176, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 176, "length": 183, "sectionHeading": "Geography | Adjacent cities", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 359, "length": 323, "sectionHeading": "Geography | Districts", "sectionLabel": "city.district"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 682, "length": 998, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1680, "length": 531, "sectionHeading": "History | Roman period", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2211, "length": 902, "sectionHeading": "History | Middle Ages", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3113, "length": 1146, "sectionHeading": "History | Industrial revolution", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4259, "length": 1737, "sectionHeading": "History | World War II", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5996, "length": 899, "sectionHeading": "History | Post-World War II period", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6895, "length": 863, "sectionHeading": "History | Links to the September 11 attacks", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7758, "length": 141, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7899, "length": 422, "sectionHeading": "Demographics | Turks in Duisburg", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 8321, "length": 784, "sectionHeading": "Transport | Duisburg Port", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 9105, "length": 1004, "sectionHeading": "Transport | Roads", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 10109, "length": 618, "sectionHeading": "Transport | Public transport", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 10727, "length": 687, "sectionHeading": "Media", "sectionLabel": "city.media"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 11414, "length": 1402, "sectionHeading": "Culture", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 12816, "length": 782, "sectionHeading": "Sport", "sectionLabel": "city.sport"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan,_Texas", "type": "city", "title": "Bryan, Texas", "abstract": "Bryan is a city in Brazos County, Texas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 76,201. As of May 2017, the estimated population was 84,637. It is the county seat of Brazos County and is located in the heart of the Brazos Valley (southeast Central Texas). It borders the city of College Station, which lies to its south. Together they are referred to as the Bryan\u2013College Station metropolitan area, which has a population of more than 250,000.\n", "text": "The area around Bryan was part of a land grant to Moses Austin by Spain. Austin's son, Stephen F. Austin, helped bring settlers to the area. Among the settlers was William Joel Bryan, the nephew of Stephen Austin. In 1866 the county seat of Brazos County was changed from Boonville to Bryan, and a post office was opened. In 1867, after many delays caused by the Civil War, the Houston and Texas Central Railroad, which had only previously gotten as far as Millican, finally reached Bryan. A short time later, in 1871, the city of Bryan became incorporated. Just south of Bryan, Texas A&M College opened in 1876 in what later would be known as College Station. The following year, 1877 saw the establishment of the Bryan Independent School District. Keeping up with progress in the rest of the country, Bryan added electric lighting and a waterworks to its community in 1889. The fifth Brazos County courthouse was built in 1892, and by the turn of the century, in 1900, the International-Great Northern Railroad stopped in Bryan.\nUsing a generous grant of $10,000 from Andrew Carnegie, the Carnegie Library of Bryan opened its doors in 1902. In 1910 the town built an interurban railroad to College Station. By 1923 the line was abandoned. The first Jewish place of worship, the Temple Freda synagogue, was opened in 1913. During the 1930s the town of North Oakwood merged with Bryan. Now Bryan and College Station are \"twin\" cities. In 1936 State Highway 6 was built, running right through town.\nIn 2006 the Texas A&M University System announced that the new Texas A&M Health Science Center campus would be built in Bryan near the new Traditions Golf Course development. \nA fire at the El Dorado Chemical Co. in 2009 caused the evacuation of 70,000 residents due to the burning of ammonium nitrate, possibly causing minor respiratory problems. However, the city requested that only \"anyone who can smell smoke or see smoke to evacuate their homes and businesses\" and did not enforce an evacuation except for 500 homes in the nearby vicinity of the fire. Less than 1,000 residents chose to evacuate, taking shelter at Texas A&M University, which closed its campus for the day to ease traffic problems. City fire officials chose to let the fire burn down before tackling it, since the chemicals were water reactive. The evacuation, which started at 2:30 pm CST ended at 7 pm, except for a small, defined area immediately around the fire, where approximately 100 Bryan residents lived. In the end, only 500 residents were under a mandatory evacuation, and 35 people were treated for respiratory problems from the smoke. Officials from El Dorado said there was never any danger from the smoke or fire. The warehouse, valued at just under $1 million, was destroyed.\nIn 2010 the Brazos County District Attorney's Office started the enforcement of a \"Gang Safety Zone\" in response to an escalation in violence within Bryan. Major US papers and ABC News covered this move. Cities like Houston and Los Angeles looked to the Bryan model of safety enforcement surrounding gang violence. The injunction declared a area in Bryan as the Gang Safety Zone. This placed about half of downtown in the area.\nIn 2013 the Planned Parenthood clinic in Bryan closed as a result of state budget cuts which impacted family-planning facilities.

In 2017, the winery launched its Vineyard District subdivision in which homeowners will be encouraged to cultivate grapes in their yards. Winery co-founders Paul and Merrill Bonarrigo own thirty-three lots on forty-eight acres which are available for development. At the time the Bonarrigos founded Messina Hof, the winery was the only development in the area. Then a winery in Austin developed a subdivision where the residents base their community activity on the winery itself. Vineyard District houses will be based on the \"homes for a lifetime\" concept, with emphasis on entertainment and cooking and ease of use for older adults and those physically limited. The Bonarrigos hope to bring this concept to Bryan and College Station.\nThe Brazos Transit District began offering bus service in the Bryan-College Station in 1974.

In 2008, Torrington was named by Bizjournals as the number one \"Dreamtown\" (micropolitan statistical area) out of ten in the United States to live in.\n", "text": "Torrington was first settled in 1735 by Ebenezer Lyman, Jr., of Durham, Connecticut. Its early settlers resided on the hills west of the Naugatuck River where the first school, church, store, and tavern were constructed. Later, the eastern hill known as Torringford was settled, as it provided the best farmland. Torrington was given permission to organize a government and incorporate as a town in October 1740.\nThe fast moving waters of the Naugatuck River were used to power early nineteenth-century industries. Industrial growth skyrocketed when Frederick Wolcott constructed a woolen mill in 1813. The mill attracted a large workforce and created demands for goods, services, and housing.\nIsrael Coe and Erastus Hodges began the construction of two brass mills on the Naugatuck River in 1834. This event sparked the beginning of the brass industry in Torrington, which later would spread throughout the entire Naugatuck Valley. In 1849, the Naugatuck Valley railroad was completed, connecting Torrington with other population centers, ending its isolation, and stimulating further industrial growth. Soon, Torrington was producing a variety of metal products, including needles, brass, hardware, bicycles, and tacks. Torrington's growing industrial plants attracted English, Irish, and German immigrants throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Between 1880 and 1920, Torrington's population exploded from 3,000 to 22,000 as immigration from southern and eastern Europe increased; most immigrants during this period were Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, and Italians. Torrington was chartered as a city in 1923.\nIn 1955, a massive flood destroyed much of the downtown area and other property in the region when Hurricane Connie and Hurricane Diane caused local rivers to overflow. Torrington is home to several state parks, one of which is the very popular Burr Pond State Park. In 1851, Milo Burr placed a dam across the confluence of several mountain streams impounding water for power. The tannery and three active sawmills erected downstream consumed the finest pines and oaks for miles around to meet the needs of lumber production. The clearings became homesites, and Connecticut's industrial leadership was further strengthened. Burr Pond was designated as a state park in 1949. The pond itself has several small inlets and islands. The shore is rocky and there are deep drop-offs in several places, but the pond only has a maximum depth of thirteen feet. Fish species present include largemouth bass, chain pickerel, black crappie, yellow perch, bluegill, pumpkinseed, and brown bullhead.\nGail Borden, discoverer of the process of milk preservation by evaporation and condensation, built the world's first condensed milk factory here, in 1857. The new milk product proved to be of great value, particularly to the Union Army during the Civil War. Fire destroyed the mill in 1877. A bronze tablet marks its site, just below the falls.\nTorrington is the birthplace of abolitionist John Brown.\nIn the year 2000, the Torrington Historical Society acquired the property in merger with the John Brown Association. Plans are now being formulated to improve visitor services and to construct interpretive trails on the property.\nhttp://www.torringtonhistoricalsociety.org.\nTorrington is planning to revitalize its downtown area in an effort to attract residents and visitors to the city's shopping and cultural opportunities. These redevelopment plans are still in discussion and are not yet completed. The City of Torrington will receive $500,000 for improvements and streetscape enhancements to Torrington\u2019s Main Street and downtown. The grant, which will flow through the state, will be designated for downtown improvements on the east side of Main Street and will include, among other enhancements, new sidewalks. A $750,000 grant for downtown improvements secured earlier in 2012 for the west side of Main Street will make similar improvements.\nThe following ideas have been discussed:\nThe historic restoration and renovation to downtown Coe Memorial Park were completed in the beginning of 2004. The Coe Memorial Park Subcommittee and the City of Torrington, worked closely with Ferrero Hixon Associates, to restore the Park to a Victorian walking park, much as it was when it was first gifted to the Town in 1906. These renovations included new sidewalks and paths, and the relocation of memorials and monuments. In 2005, award-winning horticulturist, Gwenythe B. Harvey, owner of the firm The Garden Goddess, LLC, was hired to redefine, design and upgrade existing garden areas. Coe Memorial Park's Botanical Gardens has since become a well-known tourist destination.\nTorrington hopes to attract a wide variety of merchants into its downtown setting. Empty and abandoned buildings would be converted into a mix of retail, office, and residential space. A potential plan discusses the possibility of a national clothing retailer or bookstore chain constructing a location at the top of Water Street on the site of the Kelley Bus Company. This plan had come under fire by some because it involves the demolition of the former Torrington railroad station, which is considered by many to be historical. Despite this, the 113-year-old former Torrington railroad station was demolished, as a safety hazard, on January 4, 2011. The historical society was able to save a few pieces, including the ticket window and some of the terra-cotta ornaments from the outside of the building. A Big Y supermarket and a Lowe's Home Improvement store opened in the summer of 2009 on Winsted Road.\nA parking garage is slated to be constructed in the heart of downtown on either Main Street or Water Street. The municipal parking lot next to the Torrington Library would also serve as a downtown parking area. Because the downtown redevelopment project emphasizes pedestrian access, brick sidewalks lined with trees, benches, and bike racks would be constructed along Main Street.\nTo relieve congestion, the city plans to convert the Main Street/Water Street/East Main Street downtown intersection into a \"+\" shape, rather than its current criticized setup. The city expects to convert Main Street into a one-way road with parking lining one side of the street. The neighboring Prospect Street would also be converted into a one-way road with traffic flowing in the opposite direction. Most of the roads are in medium to poor condition and filled with pot holes.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 40.4 square miles (104.6 km\u00b2). Approximately 39.8 square miles (103.1 km\u00b2) of it is land and 1.5 km\u00b2 (0.6 sq mi or 1.41%) of it is water.\nThe eastern and western sides of the city, at its borders, are at the tops of peaks, while the downtown and central sections of the city are in the Naugatuck River Valley. This provides some interesting views from the higher locations, with the city lights as a backdrop below. Due to the lack of suitable highways and bypass routes in an East/West direction, crossing the city requires driving down into the valley and back up the other side.\nThis climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification system, Torrington has a humid continental climate, abbreviated \"Dfb\" on climate maps.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 35,202 people, 14,743 households, and 9,125 families residing in the city. The population density was 884.7 people per square mile (341.6/km\u00b2). There were 16,147 housing units at an average density of 405.8 per square mile (156.7/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the city was 93.03% White, 2.15% Black or African American, 0.20% Native American, 1.83% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 1.31% from other races, and 1.47% from two or more races.

Located on the Ramganga, it is the capital of Bareilly division and the geographical region of Rohilkhand. The city is north of the state capital, Lucknow, and east of the national capital, New Delhi. Bareilly is the fourth city in Uttar Pradesh with compressed natural gas (CNG) filling stations (after Lucknow, Kanpur and Agra). It is the Eight largest metropolis in Uttar Pradesh and the 50th-largest city in India. Bareilly also figured amongst the PM Narendra Modi's ambitious 100 Smart City list in India.\nThe city is also known by the name Fairy.(known for the four Shiva temples located in four corners of the region - Dhopeshwar Nath, Madni Nath, Alakha Nath and Trivati Nath), Ala Hazrat, Shah Sharafat Miyan and Khankahe Niyazia (derived the famous Muslim Mausoleum), Zari nagari and historically as Sankasya (where the Buddha descended from Tushita to earth). The city is a centre for furniture manufacturing and trade in cotton, cereal and sugar. Its status grew with its inclusion in the \"counter magnets\" list of the National Capital Region (NCR), a list also including Hissar, Patiala, Kota and Gwalior. The city is also known as Bans-Bareilly. Although Bareilly is a production centre for cane (bans) furniture, \"Bans Bareilly\" is not derived from the bans market; it was named for two princes: Bansaldev and Baraldev, sons of Jagat Singh Katehriya, who founded the city in 1537. \nParsakhera is a major industrial area\n", "text": "According to the epic Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Bareilly region (Panchala) is said to be the birthplace of Draupadi, who was also referred to as 'Panchali' (one from the kingdom of Panch\u0101la) by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101 (Lord Krishna). When Yudhishthira becomes the king of Hastinapura at the end of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Draupadi becomes his queen. The folklore says that Gautama Buddha had once visited the ancient fortress city of Ahichchhatra in Bareilly. The Jain Tirthankara Parshva is said to have attained Kaivalya at Ahichchhatra.\nIn the 12th century, the kingdom was under the rule by different clans of Kshatriya Rajputs. Then the region became part of the Muslim Turkic Delhi Sultanate for 325 years before getting absorbed in the emerging Mughal Empire. The foundation of the modern City of Bareilly foundation was laid by Mughal governor Mukrand Rai in 1657 during the rule of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb.\nLater the region became the capital of Rohilkhand region before getting handed over to Nawab Vazir of Awadh and then to East India Company (transferred to the British India) and later becoming an integral part of India. The region has, also, acted as a mint for a major part of its history.\nFrom archaeological point of view the district of Bareilly is very rich. The extensive remains of Ahichchhatra, the Capital town of Northern Panchala have been discovered near Ramnagar village of Aonla Tehsil in the district. It was during the first excavations at Ahichchhatra (1940\u201344) that the painted grey ware, associated with the advent of the Aryans in the Ganges\u2013Yamuna Valley, was recognised for the first time in the earliest levels of the site. Nearly five thousand coins belonging to periods earlier than that of Guptas have been yielded from Ahichchhatra. It has also been one of the richest sites in India from the point of view of the total yield of terracotta. Some of the masterpieces of Indian terracotta art are from Ahichchhatra. In fact the classification made of the terracotta human figurines from Ahichchhatra on grounds of style and to some extent stratigraphy became a model for determining the stratigraphy of subsequent excavations at other sites in the Ganges Valley. On the basis of the existing material, the archaeology of the region helps us to get an idea of the cultural sequence from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC up to the 11th century AD. Some ancient mounds in the district have also been discovered by the Deptt. of Ancient History and culture, Rohilkhand University, at Tihar-Khera (Fatehganj West), Pachaumi, Rahtuia, Kadarganj and Sainthal.\nBareilly was founded in 1537 by Basdeo, a Katehriya Rajput. The city was first mentioned by the historian Budayuni, who wrote that Husain Quli Khan was appointed the governor of \"Bareilly and Sambhal\" in 1568. The divisions and revenue of the district \"being fixed by Todar Mal\" were recorded by Abul Fazl in 1596. The foundation of the modern city of Bareilly was laid by Mughal governor Mukrand Rai in 1657. In 1658, Bareilly became the headquarters of the province of Budaun.\nThe Mughal policy of encouraging Afghan settlements to control the Katehriyas succeeded if the central government was strong. After Aurangzeb's death, the Afghans (who had become local potentates) began to seize and occupy neighbouring villages.\nAfter the fall of the Mughal Empire, many Pathans migrated from Rohilkhand. Bareilly (like other cities in Uttar Pradesh) experienced economic stagnation and poverty, leading to the migration of Rohilla Muslim Pathans to Suriname and Guyana as indentured labour.\nUnder Barech at the 1761 Third Battle of Panipat, Rohilkhand blocked the expansion of the Maratha Empire into northern India. In 1772 it was invaded by the Marathas, repulsing the invasion with the aid of the Nawab of Awadh. After the war, Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula demanded payment for the nawabs' help from Barech. When his demand was refused, the nawab joined the British (under Governor Warren Hastings and his Commander-in-Chief, Alexander Champion) to invade Rohilkhand. The combined forces of Daula and the Company defeated Barech (who was killed in battle at Miranpur Katra, ending Rohilla rule) in 1774.\nRohilkhand was handed over to Daula, and from 1774 to 1800 the province was ruled by the Nawab of Awadh. By 1801, subsidies due under the treaties to support a British force had fallen into arrears. To pay the debt, Nawab Saadat Ali Khan surrendered Rohilkhand to the East India Company in a treaty signed on 10 November 1801.\nDuring the reign of Shah Alam II, Bareilly was the headquarters of Rohilla Sardar Hafiz Rehmat Khan and many coins were minted. The city was later in the possession of Awadh Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah, and his coins had Bareilly, Bareilly Aasfabad and the Bareilly kite and fish as identification marks. Coins were then minted by the East India Company.\nAfter the Rohilla War, the change in the power structure increased discontent throughout the district. Increased taxation from 1812 to 1814 increased resentment of the British: \"Business stood still, shops were shut and multitudes assembled near the courthouse to petition for the abolition of the tax.\" The Magistrate Dembleton, already unpopular, ordered the assessment to be made by a Kotwal. A skirmish between rebels and the sepoys (under Captain Cunningham) cost 300\u2013400 lives. In 1818, Robert Glyn was posted as Acting Judge and Magistrate of Bareilly and the Joint Magistrate of Bulundshahr.\nRobert Glyn asked Ghulam Yahya to write an account of \"craftsmen, the names of tools of manufacture and production and their dress and manners\". The most popular trades in and around Bareilly during the 1820s were manufacturing glass, jewellery, glass and lac bangles and gold and silver thread, crimping, bean drying, wire drawing, charpoy weaving, keeping a grocer's shop and selling kebabs.\nBareilly was a centre of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The rebellion began as a mutiny of native soldiers (sepoys), employed by the British East India Company's army, against race- and religion-based injustices and inequities on 10 May 1857 in Meerut. It expanded into other mutinies and civilian rebellions, primarily in the major north-central Indian river valleys; local episodes extended northwest to Peshawar (on the northwest frontier with Afghanistan) and southeast (beyond Delhi). There were riots in many parts of Uttar Pradesh, and Muslims in Bareilly, Bijnor and Moradabad called for the revival of a Muslim kingdom.\nThe Rohillas actively opposed the British, but were disarmed. Khan Bahadur Khan Rohilla, grandson of Hafiz Rahmat Khan, formed his own government in Bareilly in 1857 and a widespread popular revolt in Awadh, Bundelkhand and Rohilkhand took place. In 1857, Khan Bhadur Khan issued silver coins from Bareilly as an independent ruler. When the rebellion failed, Bareilly was subjugated. Khan Bahadur Khan was sentenced to death, and hanged in the police station on 24 February 1860.\nBareilly Central Jail housed a number of political prisoners during the British Raj, including Yashpal (who married while imprisoned on 7 August 1936 was the first such ceremony in an Indian jail). The rules were changed, preventing future prison marriages.\nBareilly is in northern India, at . On its east are Pilibhit and Shahjahanpur, Rampur on the west, Udham Singh Nagar (Uttarakhand) to the north and Badaun to the south. The city is level and well-watered, sloping towards the south. Its soil is fertile, with groves of trees. A rain forest in the north, known as the tarai, contains tigers, bears, deer and wild pigs. The river Sarda (or Gogra) forms the eastern boundary and is the principal waterway. The Ramganga receives most of the drainage from the Kumaon mountains, and the Deoha also receives many small streams. The Gomati (or Gumti) is also nearby.\nBareilly is on the Ganges plain, with fertile alluvial soil; however, the lower plain is flood-prone.

The town administratively belonged to the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998. According to data from 2016, the city has 14,534 inhabitants. G\u0142owno is a twin town of Germany's Remptendorf commune.\n", "text": "Although the first settlement at the site of present-day G\u0142owno is thought to have appeared in the 11th century, the first town was organized in the early 15th century near a trade route from the Duchy of Masovia to the Polish kingdom. Rawa Mazowiecka feudal lord and Sochaczew podczaszy (deputy cup-bearer) Jakub Glowienski founded G\u0142owno's first Roman Catholic church, which was consecrated on March 11, 1420 as the Church of St. Jacob. On Jakub's request, Duke Siemowit V of Masovia granted city rights under Kulm law. The city rights have been maintained until the modern day, with an interruption between the years 1870\u20131925.\nUpon incorporation of the Rawa dukedom into the Kingdom of Poland in 1462 a new voivodeship was established called the Rawa Voivodeship. Glowno belonged to that voivodeship until 1793 or the second partition of Poland. In 1504 a fire destroyed a large part of the city, whereupon King Alexander Jagiellon suspended taxation for its inhabitants for ten years. In 1522 second fire struck and King Sigismund I the Old granted another 10 year taxation reprieve. Because of the Deluge and the rebellion under Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski, the population severely diminished, and in 1676, only 74 people lived in G\u0142owno, but under the rule of King John III Sobieski the town population recovered somewhat. During the Great Northern War the town and church were ransacked by Saxon and Swedish troops, including a short but devastating stay by Swedish king Charles XI and his mounted troops in 1704, recorded by the parson of the Saint Jacob church. Consequently, in 1710, an epidemic struck, killing inhabitants from local nobility to town peoples, and town was almost finished. Finally the city was sold to Baltazar Ciecierski stolnik of Drohiczyn. After the 1730s and perhaps closer to 1750, new owner started settling Jews there, in order to create income from textile industry. In 1741 King August III the Saxon granted market privileges to Ciecierski's town, allowing the town to hold four market fairs during a calendar year. In 1775 there were 60 tax paying households in the town.\nIn 1793, the Second Partition of Poland took place, whereby the city was taken over by Prussia. With the resurgence of Polish statehood and establishment of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1806, the area was incorporated therein. In 1815, upon defeat of Napoleon town fell to the Russians and became part of the newly formed Congress Poland.\nIn 1869, Russian occupying authorities took away G\u0142owno's city rights, a strong punitive measure intended as a humiliation for its citizens' participation in the January Uprising. In 1870, Czar Alexander II of Russia downgraded a large number of Polish cities from towns to villages in all of Polish territories under Russian administration, and Glowno suffered the same fate.\nIn 1903, the railway connection between Warsaw and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was built through G\u0142owno, therewith representing a positive factor for the economy. The first volunteer fire department was formed in 1908. In 1924, the \"Buch and Werner Norblin Brothers\" company opened a factory branch in G\u0142owno. Upon resurrection of the Polish Republic in 1918, the new Polish government reestablished the lost city status and rights in 1925.\nWith the outbreak of World War II on September 1, 1939, the area was a scene of the Battle of Bzura and some fighting occurred in G\u0142owno vicinity. The town was overrun by the German Wehrmacht during the second week of September. Nazi German administration was established and G\u0142owno became part of German administrative unit known as General Government. During the occupation numerous acts of Polish resistance, Armia Krajowa etc., occurred in G\u0142owno including the clandestine execution of a Roman Catholic priest who worked as an informant for the Nazi police. Nazi reprisals took the lives of many citizens, including those murdered in mass executions at the town's cemetery and inside the town's German police headquarters and also in the Nazi occupied Warsaw's infamous prison Pawiak. Many citizens were forced into slave labor for the Germans and some were shipped to various factories and farms across Germany.\nThe German authorities established a Jewish ghetto in G\u0142owno in May 1940, in order to confine its Jewish population for the purpose of persecution and exploitation. The ghetto was liquidated in March 1941, when all its 5,600 inhabitants were transported in cattle trucks to \u0141owicz and from there to the Warsaw Ghetto, the largest ghetto in all of Nazi occupied Europe with over 400,000 Jews crammed into an area of , or 7.2 persons per room. By the time Nazi-occupied Poland was liberated, not a single Jewish ghetto remained on Polish lands. \nSoviet Red Army took Glowno in January 1945, and there was Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944\u201346), by cursed soldiers, in and around the town. After the war many factories have been built in town, as the population expanded schools have been built and generally town prospered until the crisis of the 1980s when along with the rest of the country town and its inhabitants suffered serious economic hardships and curtailed civil rights and freedoms, many of the numerous workers being members of the Solidarity Movement. In the 1990s, under the III Polish Republic, town and the inhabitants at first prospered, however plagued by quality of life crimes, especially its textile and automotive factories and manufactures were expanding, but this boom suffered collapse by the end of the decade, most of the textile manufacturing in bankruptcy and factories facing closures etc. Since the joining of the European Union by Poland, many town inhabitants left in search of better life in nearby capital city of Warsaw and Pozna\u0144, and especially large migration has been witnessed to the United Kingdom, since 2010 to Germany and some to Italy, and town's population decreased.\nG\u0142owno is located in the Central Polish Lowlands (Nizina Polska), within the smaller geographical area of \u0141owicz-B\u0142o\u0144ska Plain at the confluence of three small rivers: Mroga, Mro\u017cyca, and Brzu\u015bnia. There are two dammed lakes with the total area of around 39 hectares, both fed by the waters of Mroga River. The city's elevation is from 119.3 to 145.9 meters, the higher number belongs to the northern part of the town, above sea level. The valleys of Mroga and Mro\u017cyca form a natural, ecological contour of G\u0142owno. The town area is a rather flat surface, and only the edges of the river valleys and a small chain of sand dunes in the center of the town (known as Marakan) form any variation in otherwise flat landscape. The land area of G\u0142owno consists of 1,867 hectares, or 18.67 square kilometers. Town is located 29 kilometers northeast of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and about 100 kilometers southwest of the Polish capital, Warsaw.

The population was 13,151 at the 2010 census and an estimated 13,513 as of 2016. Lebanon is located in western New Hampshire, south of Hanover, near the Connecticut River. It is the home to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and Dartmouth Medical School, together comprising the largest medical facility between Boston, Massachusetts and Burlington, Vermont.\nTogether with Hanover, New Hampshire, and White River Junction, Vermont, Lebanon today is at the center of a Micropolitan Statistical Area, encompassing nearly 30 towns along the upper Connecticut River valley.\n", "text": "Lebanon was chartered as a town by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth on July 4, 1761, one of 16 along the Connecticut River. It was named for Lebanon, Connecticut, from where many early settlers had come or would come, including the Rev. Eleazar Wheelock, who arrived in 1770 and founded Dartmouth College. Lebanon, Connecticut was the original home of Moor's Indian Charity School, the antecedent of Dartmouth College.\nEarly settlement concentrated along the Connecticut River in what is now West Lebanon, and along the Mascoma Lake region near Enfield. In the mid-19th century, a mill district developed at falls on the Mascoma River. Industries included, at various times, furniture mills, a tannery, several machine shops, a woolen textile mill and a clothing factory. In the mid-19th century, this district attracted many French workers from Canada's Quebec province. This became the center of town, although West Lebanon grew into a railroad hub with a separate identity after lines entered from Boston. This rail center would become known as Westboro after two trains collided when West Lebanon was mistaken for Lebanon.\nThe mill district, like the railroad, declined into the 1950s and 1960s. The town suffered two major fires; the second, in 1964, destroyed a large portion of the old mill district. Reconstruction resulted in a controversial urban renewal project featuring a closed-off district, called The Mall, built to replace the destroyed Hanover Street area. Partly in defiance of economic decline, and partly to counter a movement by West Lebanon to declare itself an independent town, Lebanon re-incorporated as a city in 1958. \nThe routing of Interstates 89 and 91 through Lebanon and nearby White River Junction, Vermont, in addition to the growth of Dartmouth College, led to the area's economic revival. The former mill town now has a mixed economy based on education, medical services, high-technology and retail. Just south of the village of West Lebanon, a major shopping district has sprung up at the intersection of Route 12A and I-89. Lebanon has undertaken improvements to its recreational facilities, including miles of hiking trails, a municipal ski area, a swimming pool and several sports fields.\nIn 1991, the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, along with most departments of Dartmouth Medical School, moved from Hanover to a new campus just south of the Lebanon-Hanover town line.

It is part of the San Antonio-New Braunfels Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 7,341 at the 2010 census.\n", "text": "According to anthropologists, the area was occupied seasonally from about 5,000 B.C. by small bands of nomadic Native American tribes in search of food and game. The Lipan Apache moved into the area in the late 17th century and occupied it throughout the 18th century. However, the Lipan were forced from the area in the early 1820s by the Comanche Indians.\nA small farming and ranching community began to develop in the area shortly after the Texas Revolution in the late 1830s. The ranches suffered occasional attacks by the Comanches until the late 1870s.\nIn 1858, a Scottish immigrant, Dr. George Marnoch, purchased the land that would later become the site of the town. Marnoch's home at one time served as a stagecoach stop and a post office for cowboys driving their cattle from Bandera to auction in San Antonio. His heirs sold a portion of their property in 1880 to a Swiss immigrant, Arnold Gugger, who built a home and mercantile store around which the town of Helotes sprang to life. In 1908, Gugger sold his property to Bert Hileman, who opened the town's first dance hall. He was also instrumental in getting old Bandera Road paved and opening the town's first filling station. He sold his property in downtown Helotes in 1919, when the town's population declined.\nIn 1946, the manager of San Antonio's Majestic Theatre, John T. Floore, opened the landmark John T. Floore Country Store, which is actually a dance hall (or honky tonk) that draws top country music talent including Willie Nelson who still plays the venue on occasion. Floore also financed the first annual Helotes Cornyval festival in the 1960s, which was held to celebrate the opening of a new post office. \nCorn played an important role in the heritage of Helotes. The local Native Americans planted corn, actually maize, in the fertile valleys of the area, and feed corn was a major crop grown in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The town name is derived from the Spanish word elote, which can mean \"ear of maize\", \"corncob\", or simply \"corn\", but exactly how the town came to be called Helotes is still a subject of debate.\nAs the urban sprawl of San Antonio expanded and approached the outskirts of Helotes in the 1970s, residents determined to take their fate into their own hands. After a decade of planning and negotiation, Helotes became an incorporated city in October 1981. To this day, residents still struggle with the dilemma of maintaining the city's rugged country charm, while at the same time allowing for the development of modern suburban facilities and businesses. Helotes was the hometown of the late Texas state Senator Frank L. Madla, who died after his home on the south side of San Antonio caught fire on November 24, 2006.\nWhen Helotes incorporated in 1981, there was very little in the town. Now with a population of over 7,000, Helotes is becoming one of the most desirable suburbs of San Antonio. Helotes itself includes the newly renovated Old Town Helotes. Completed in 2011, Old Town Helotes is the revitalized downtown of Helotes, which includes John T. Floore's Country Store, All That Glitters, L&M Feed and Supply, Mander Automotive Service, First Baptist Church of Helotes, Elf Hardware, HelotesTactical Firearms, Helotes Creek Winery and El Chaparral Mexican Restaurant. Helotes is home to Oak Valley golf course, the first golf course in south Texas to be fully lit at night. The Morales family built the golf course on their vast acres of land acquired by Lorenzo Morales, a pillar of the community. He was extremely influential in settling Helotes. \nOther shopping centers off the major thoroughfare of Bandera Road include Walmart, CVS Pharmacy, Dollar General, Dairy Queen, Bill Miller BBQ, Sonic, Starbucks, BBVA Compass Bank, Broadway Bank, and the Helotes Post Office. At the intersection of Loop 1604 and Bandera Road are the popular Bandera Trails Center and Bandera Centre Shopping Center.

Maxx, and many other stores and restaurants.\nThe Cornyval Festival is an annual city tradition bringing in local vendors and thousands of area residents to celebrate the namesake of the town.\nHelotes is located in northwestern Bexar County in the valley of Helotes Creek where it exits from the Texas Hill Country. The city is approximately northwest of downtown San Antonio. Texas State Highway 16 runs through the community, leading northwest to Bandera. The Charles W.

Because of the disastrous floods that occur during rainy seasons in suburban Poblacion of Nabua, Father Felix de Huertas, the then parish priest, advised the farmers to move to I-raga (donde hay tierra or where there is land) where they can plant their crops without fear of being flooded. The flood victims of Nabua who moved earlier and followed the suggestions of their parish priest were the fortunate beneficiaries of the harvest of their agricultural plantation coming from the rich and fertile soils of I-raga, more so, those who planted at the foot of Sumagang Mountain (Mountain of the Rising Sun, now Mt. Iriga) said to be nature\u2019s given symbol of the Irigue\u00f1os lofty ideals and noble visions.\nAs population spread out and evangelization progressed, the settlement at the foot of Sumagang Mountain developed in size and wealth, slowly pushing the aborigines (Agta) up to the thickness of the forest. And in 1578 the I-raga settlement was established as \u201cvisita\u201d of Nabua under Fray Pablo de Jesus and Fray Bartolome Ruiz, both Franciscans. Three decades later or on January 4, 1641, Mount Asog (named after a negrito chieftain who ruled the aborigines) or Mt. Iriga, erupted. That eruption brought much fear to the settlers but with their strong faith and belief a miracle happened and as witnessed by local folks, the apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mother and her son Lord Jesus or \u201cNuestra Se\u00f1ora de Angustia\u201d at sitio Inorogan saved the people from terrible earthquake and flood. The eruption formed the cavernous gully on the side of Buhi leading to the steep gorge which was the crater of the \u201cvolcano\u201d.\nIriga, according to Fray Felix Huertas in his lengthily-titled Estado Geografico, Topografico, Estadisticdo, Historico-Reliogoso de la Santa Apostolica Provincia de S. Gregorio Magno published in 1865, came from the native word iraga, which means \u201cposeedores de mucho terreno,\u201d or \u201cpossessors of much land.\u201d From a mere \u201cdoctrina,\u201d a religious administrative word which roughly means a \u201cmission post\u201d in 1583.\nIn 1683, this progressive visita of I-raga was converted into Pueblo de la Provincia de Ambos Camarines with a population of 8,908 which several decades later the name I-raga was changed to Iriga by the dipthongal Spanish authorities and advocated St. Anthony of Padua as Patron Saint and June 13 as the annual fiesta.\nFrom the middle of the 19th century until the first two decades of the 20th century, Iriga was a major abaca-producing town in the Bicol region, largely because of the rich volcanic soil surrounding Mt. Iriga which it spewed in its last eruption about six hundred years before the coming of the Spaniards in Bikol.\nAccording to William Freer, the American Superintendent of Schools in Camarines Sur, \u201cThe sides of the mountain nourish rich plantations of abaca owned by several Spaniards, and shelter several hundreds of the Philippine aborigines, the Negritos, who are now employed on the plantations. Because of the production of abaca the town of Iriga ranks third in importance in Camarines, being outclassed only by Nueva Caceres and Daet.\u201d\nDuring the incumbency of Don Martin Mendoza as Capitan Municipal, in the memorias de la Provincia de Ambos Camarines, showed that the \u201cPueblo de Iriga\u201d was composed of \u201cbarrios y visitas distinguida la poblacion centro del casco en 5 barrios que son San Roque, San Francisco de Asis, San Juan Bautista, Sto. Domingo de Guzman y San Miguel Arcangel con 6 visitas fuera del casco denominados San Nicolas de Tolentino, San Agustin, San Antonio Abad, Sto. Ni\u00f1o, Santiago de Galicia y la visita de los monteses\u201d with a population of 13,813. There were only four roads mentioned, they were coming from Nabua going to Baao, to Buhi and to Polangui, Albay, now the diversion road passing Salvacion, Masoli, Bato, then to the south road going to Polangui, Albay and there was only one way going to Nueva Caceres (Naga) via Bicol River by boat.\nIn 1913, the Manila Railroad (MRR) Company Station and the public market were established in their respective present site which readily contributed to the rapid growth of Iriga making it the center of trade and commerce in Rinconada area. It was also at this time that Mondays and Thursdays were declared as market days in Iriga.\nThe Municipality of Iriga continued to prosper through the years. The original \u201cbarrios y visitas\u201d have developed sitios which later on, these sitios have metamorphosed into distinct and separate barrios.\nAfter the Second World War, San Ramon, San Rafael, Cristo Rey, Sta. Isabel, San Vicente Norte, San Andres, Sta. Teresita, Perpetual Help, Sagrada, Ni\u00f1o Jesus, San Pedro and Antipolo, former sitios of barrio San Agustin, San Isidro and San Nicolas were created as barrios. And, the barrios of La Anunciacion and Sta. Elena were sitios of Sto. Domingo and Santiago, Del Rosario (Banao) of Santiago and Sto. Ni\u00f1o and La Purisima of San Francisco & part of Sto. Domingo, Sta. Cruz Sur of San Francisco. Francia and San Jose from San Miguel and San Vicente Sur, Salvacion, La Trinidad and La Medalla from the large barrio of San Antonio.\nSome of these barrios were already created during the incumbency of Mayor Jose C. Villanueva in 1960. And the latest and the 36th barrio ever created was Sta. Maria which comprises the sitios of Tubigan, Katungdulan, Bagacay, Sampaga, Rao and Cawayan of barrio Sta. Teresita by virtue of Republic Act 6228. \nAS A CITY\nThrough the unflinching support and willful cooperation of the town\u2019s people, Mayor Jose C. Villanueva at the helm of stewardship successfully gained the conversion of Iriga into the signing of R.A 5261 otherwise known as the Charter of Iriga City on July 8, 1968 by then President Ferdinand E. Marcos, considered to be the turning point of Iriga. The City, however, was formally organized and inaugurated as the third city of Bicol on September 3, 1968 by Presidential Proclamation and officiated by the President of the Philippines.\nSince then, Iriga City has developed tremendously making it not only as the center of trade and commerce in Rinconada area but the whole Bicol Region as well, as it is strategically located in between the cities of Naga and Legazpi.\nIn 2004, Madelaine Alfelor-Gazmen, the daughter of the late Camarines Sur congressman, Ciriaco R. Alfelor and granddaughter of Camarines Sur Governor Felix O. Alfelor, became Iriga\u2019s first woman city mayor, and only the third city mayor after his uncle, Emmanuel R. Alfelor was similarly elected in 1994 and served the city for 3 consecutive terms (1994-2004).\nIn her last term in 2013, Mayor Gazmen, has already made her mark as a no-nonsense city executive when she transferred the operations of the city government to its new home in barangay Sta. Cruz Sur. The new city hall as well the beautiful New Iriga City Public Market, the slaughterhouse and City Library, will no doubt be Mayor Gazmen\u2019s lasting legacy and monuments to the city of her own birth, the city she wants to call \u201ccity of crystal-clear springs,\u201d and where they spring eternal, like hope.\nHer administration promoted good governance and started it off by launching Iriga as a Character City on September 4, 2004 to lead and encourage others to become better persons. Strengthening the system and structure of governance became her priority. Enhancement programs like the Public Service Excellence, Ethics and Accountability Program (PSEEAP) granted by The Asia Foundation and the British Embassy, the City Development Strategy (CDS), Transparent Accountable Governance (TAG) and the Public Governance System (PGS) were adopted and institutionalized. Her overall development program for Iriga has been largely centered on the bigger context of achieving its vision of becoming an Agro-Ecotourism Center in the Philippines by 2015. Part of her approach is communicating her programs to her constituents which is meant to raise awareness and educate the people about the city\u2019s development perspective, and mobilize community participation and involvement in the various government programs. Her advocacy on good governance and responsible citizenship provided the much needed impetus guiding the city in its present status as a primary growth center in the Bicol Region. These were the same reasons that gained her and the city numerous prestigious awards and citations given by national and international entities. Grant funds for development projects and capability building totaling Php 300M. were also awarded to the city during her term.\nIn 2013, Ronald Felix Y. Alfelor, an Electrical Engineer by profession, became the next mayor of the city. He is the younger brother of former Mayor Madelaine Alfelor Gazmen. Considered one of the youngest member-mayor of the Leagues of Cities of the Philippines at 33 years old, he advocated and made a covenant to build a city with a strong and responsive good local governance that promotes responsible citizenship by: ensuring the people\u2019s security in their life, liberty and property; enhancing the participation of the citizens in local governance; providing public services to citizens to ensure a healthy, safe, and desirable environment, as well as a literate, skilled and entrepreneurial citizenry to achieve a sustainable and conducive economic and social growth so that all Irigue\u00f1os will realize their dreams and aspirations.\nHe proclaimed his mission to strive to deliver excellent public service at least cost, by adopting the principles of \u201cdoing things right the first time and walking the extra mile\u201d to ensure increased performance efficiency and development outcomes.\nIriga is bounded by the town of Buhi in the east, by the municipalities of Baao, Nabua and Bato in the west, by the province of Albay in the south, and by the municipalities of Ocampo and Sangay in the north.\nLow hills and gently waving plains but with mountain ranges.\nIn the ? , the population of Iriga, was people, with a density of .\nIrigue\u00f1os or people of Iriga speak Rinconada Bikol language. Irigue\u00f1os of Austronesian lineage are using Iriga variant while the indigenous and oboriginal groups of Agta or Negritos are using Agta variant of the language. Tagalog/Filipino and English languages are also understood and spoken. Bikol Central is also commonly understood and spoken in the Rinconada area.\nThe majority of the city residents are Roman Catholic. The Archdiocese of Nueva Caceres has several parishes and churches in the city. The biggest church can be found at the center of the city (Saint Anthony of Padua) and the Lourdes grotto symbolizes the long history of Catholicism in Iriga. Tinagba, a harvest festival can be seen a fusion of folk tradition and Catholic saint celebration.\nIglesia ni Cristo is the largest minority religion in the city. The INC's district office of ecclesiastical district of Camarines Southeast (CSE) is located in Barangay San Nicolas. The office oversees the church members in Rinconada and Partido areas in Camarines Sur, and Burias island in Masbate. Thus, a large number of INC members can be found in the city. At present, Iglesia Ni Cristo has four local congregations and two extensions in Iriga.\nIslam is a new religion in the city and most of its members are immigrants from Mindanao island. LDS Church members are also numerous, as well as Jehovah's Witnesses. Baptist adherents are also active in the city.\nIriga City Public Market is one of the busiest in the region which makes the city as the center of commerce in Rinconada district. The old Public Market was redesigned and reconstructed in 2010 and now hosts LCC supermarket, many local shops and several national chain restaurants. Sold at the new public market are locally grown and harvested organic produce such as tilapia harvested from nearby Lake Buhi and Lake Bato. Salt water fresh and dried fish from neighboring Balatan coast are sold in abundance in the market. Gift shops offering locally manufactured products made from local hemp, pili nut, bamboo and coconut are offered to local and foreign tourists.\nThe city is home to three major commercial complexes namely the LCC Mall Iriga, which was the second LCC Mall in the district, the UNP Town Mall near the University of Northeastern Philippines, and the largest and newest Regent Central Commercial Complex. National chain restaurants like Mang Inasal, Chow King, Jollibee, Biggs and Shakey's opened branches in the city. Many other fastfood and specialty restaurants are planning to open branches in the future. City Mall also explores potential sites for their new branch in the city. A new convention center was built in front of the Catholic Grotto hosts important events in the city. A new Puregold branch just opened in the city. It is the third branch of Puregold in the province of Camarines Sur to opened.\nGaisano Capital Iriga is now under construction located just in front of the Lourdes Hospital, San Roque, Iriga City.\nFound at the downtown Iriga is the City Park which is located near the cathedral and across the old City Hall. It is a well landscaped, Japanese-themed park with a huge spurting fountain at the center but was later replaced with a skating rink. Acacia trees are lit with colored lights during Christmas season. Surrounding the park are business establishments and landmarks such as the Lourdes Grotto which offers a great view of the downtown.\nThere is a number of waterfalls and springs found in the city. Several resorts and hotels were built to accommodate growing tourist arrivals. The old Ibalon Hotel was renovated and renamed as Iriga City Plaza Hotel.

The population was 723 at the 2010 census. The city began on the Caddo River in the mid-19th century when William F. Browning and others, including Dr. A.B. Clingman, at various times moved to the area. \n", "text": "Amity was founded in 1847 by several pioneer families from the Mount Bethel area of Clark County under the leadership of William F. Browning, who served as the Clark County surveyor during the years of 1846 until his death in 1854. The group settled along the Caddo River, drawn to the area by an abundance of rich bottomland and fresh water. Browning constructed a two-story log house just west of Caney Creek, which soon became the center of the expanding community. It was Browning who gave Amity its name.\nTogether with other citizens, Browning formed the Caddo Valley Baptist Church of Christ, which before several other names would later develop into the Bethel Missionary Baptist Church in Glenwood and First Baptist Church in Amity. It is thought to be the first religious organization in the area, though Dr. A.B. Clingman, a physician and minister associated with the Church of Christ was in the area before Browning's group arrived. Browning's group built a large log house that would serve as both the church and the school house. The first school teacher was Captain Robert S. Burke, a former military officer and Browning's brother-in-law. A few months later, the first Amity Post Office was established nearby.\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War, the community saw dark times. Initially in support of the Confederacy, soon the community became divided, with the men of Amity leaving to fight in both the Confederate Army and the Union Army. In several cases, families were split by their loyalties, causing turmoil within the small community. Midway through the war, Union soldiers burned the Burke schoolhouse and the Browning cotton press.\nFollowing the war's end, the center of the community shifted to a location south of the Caddo River, first settled by John Hays Allen and Dr. Amariah Biggs. Dr. Biggs was widely known as a physician and Methodist minister, and first settled in the area around 1850. The Amity Post Office was soon after relocated to this area. In 1870, retired army Colonel Philander Curtis, a Connecticut native, settled in the area. Curtis built the first house where the town of Amity now stands, and served for several years as the town's postmaster. In 1871, Col. Curtis and businessmen Riley Thompson and Jacob H. Lightsey purchased property from John Hays Allen, and on that property they laid out plans for the town, centering on a public square. By 1874 Amity had become a thriving village, with several new businesses and churches. In 1877 an adjacent area became \"Amity Township\", and in 1880 the town made a move to become incorporated, but it did not come to pass until 1907.\nIn the late 1870s a new schoolhouse was built. Its first teacher was Richard Melancthon Burke, son of Captain Robert Burke. The residents also formed the Amity Male and Female Academy, which eventually became Amity High School. Richard Burke died in 1883, and the school struggled until 1888, when Samual M. Samson arrived in Amity. Samson spent the next twenty years as the head of the high school, which at that time was a private school. After his departure, it was absorbed into the Amity Public School System.\nIn 1887, a false rumor that gold had been discovered in an area then known as the Trap Mountains resulted in a brief gold rush, which ended when the rumor proved false. Shortly after 1900, the Gurdon and Fort Smith Railroad was constructed through Amity, greatly improving the economy of the town. Soon, the logging industry began to thrive, with large sawmills opening in Rosboro and Glenwood. Amity became a main shipping and trade center for the area, and in 1905 the Bank of Amity opened, which now is on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1899 the town's first newspaper, the Amity Enterprise, went into circulation, followed by the Four-County Courier in 1915 and the Amity Owl in 1922. Just before World War II, the shortage of cinnabar caused a brief but productive mining industry in the nearby mountains south of the town, a phenomenon which became known as the Quicksilver Rush. However, any significant mining had ended by 1940, and following the war and an increased worldwide supply, the mines closed.\nWith the Bean Lumber Company opening in 1940, followed by the Barksdale Lumber Company, logging soon became the main source of employment for the town. At its peak, the Bean Lumber Company was producing more than 150 million board feet of pine lumber and 120 million board feet of treated lumber annually, making it one of the largest distributors of southern pine in the United States. The Bean Lumber Company would later open mills in Glenwood and in Buckner, Missouri.\nA.J. Hunter, who had originally come to town in 1905 to manage the city's first telephone exchange and who would later, upon the closure of the city's newspaper, begin The Owl, sold the paper in the 1940s to Marvin C. Bass of Little Rock.

The city limits span 7 square miles along the Kenai River, which empties into the Cook Inlet in the nearby city of Kenai. The Kenai River was selected by CNN Travel as one of the \"World's 15 Best Rivers for Travelers,\" due to its fishing and hunting opportunities. Soldotna is located on the western edge of the vast Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, a protected area spanning nearly 2 million acres and home to bears, moose, caribou, sheep, and many fish and bird species.\nThe city is located at the junction of the Sterling Highway and the Kenai Spur Highway, which has enabled Soldotna to develop as a service and retail hub for the Central Peninsula as well as for travelers between Anchorage and Homer. The Central Peninsula Hospital serves the medical needs of the region's residents and tourists.

Veterans of the United States armed services were given a 90-day preference over non-veterans in selecting land and filing for property. Also in that year, the Sterling Highway right-of-way was cleared of trees from Cooper Landing to Kenai. The location of present-day Soldotna was selected as the site for the highway's bridge crossing the Kenai River.\nThe construction of the Sterling Highway provided a link from the Soldotna area to the outside world. More homesteads were taken and visitors came to fish in the area. The Soldotna Post Office opened in 1949 and other businesses opened in the next few years.\nOil was discovered in the Swanson River region in 1957, bringing new economic development to the area.

Its intersection with the start of the Kenai Spur Highway, widely known as the \"Soldotna Y\" due to its previous Y-shaped configuration, is a local landmark. The Kenai Spur Highway connects neighborhoods in the north-central portion of the city to other parts of Soldotna, adjoining Ridgeway and beyond to Kenai, Salamatof and Nikiski, ending along Cook Inlet at the Captain Cook State Recreation Area.\nThe western portions of Soldotna are connected by local roads (east of the Kenai River) and Kalifornsky Beach Road (west of the river). \"K-Beach\" Road, as it is often known, is a loop to the west of the Sterling Highway. At its northern end, it straddles the southernmost portions of city limits (including Kenai Peninsula College and the Soldotna Sports Center) and adjoining Kalifornsky. Continuing past city limits, K-Beach provides an alternate access to Kenai along the south side of the Kenai River via the Warren Ames Memorial Bridge, the last road crossing downriver, then continues west and south, returning to the Sterling Highway at Kasilof.

As early as 1884, a U.S. post office existed in Yellow House Canyon. A small town, known as Old Lubbock, Lubbock, or North Town, was established about three miles to the east. In 1890, the original Lubbock merged with Monterey, another small town south of the canyon. The new town adopted the Lubbock name. The merger included moving the original Lubbock's Nicolett Hotel across the canyon on rollers to the new townsite. Lubbock became the county seat in 1891, and was incorporated on March 16, 1909. In the same year, the first railroad train arrived.\nTexas Technological College (now Texas Tech University) was founded in Lubbock in 1923. A separate university, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, opened as Texas Tech University School of Medicine in 1969.

The \"Lubbock Lights\" series of sightings received national publicity and is regarded as one of the first great \"UFO\" cases. The sightings were considered credible because they were witnessed by several respected science professors at Texas Technological College and were photographed by a Texas Tech student. The photographs were reprinted nationwide in newspapers and in Life magazine. Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official investigation of the UFO mystery, concluded the photographs were not a hoax and showed genuine objects, but dismissed the UFOs as being either \"night-flying moths\" or a type of bird called a plover reflected in the nighttime glow of Lubbock's new street lights.

During that time, the region had a varied population: Dutch, Chinese, Javanese, Indians, and more. Chinatown was located in the centre of the city.\nWhen under Dutch rule, Bengkulu had plantations. Parsi people harvested and processed nutmeg and mace. The nutmeg would be processed into confectionery products. Pepper was a large export, too. The area also produced smaller amounts of coffee and rice, however, both were primarily imported from Padang. Fruit and animal production was also significant.\nIn this city there are several British heritage buildings and fortresses, including Fort Marlborough, founded in 1713 on Long Beach, Hamilton Monument and Parr Monument in the downtown area, Bung Karno's Exile House is located on the road Soekarno-Hatta. And Jamik Mosque designed by Ir.

The other school was at an orphanage.\nIn this town lies the only state university in the province of Bengkulu, the Universitas Bengkulu (UNIB).\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 1330, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1330, "length": 721, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2051, "length": 1754, "sectionHeading": "Governance", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3805, "length": 159, "sectionHeading": "Transportation", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3964, "length": 146, "sectionHeading": "Transportation | Airport", "sectionLabel": "city.environment"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4110, "length": 159, "sectionHeading": "Transportation | Harbour", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4269, "length": 246, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4515, "length": 354, "sectionHeading": "Economy", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4869, "length": 1139, "sectionHeading": "Tourism", "sectionLabel": "city.tourism"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6008, "length": 387, "sectionHeading": "Culture", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6395, "length": 437, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turku", "type": "city", "title": "Turku", "abstract": "Turku (] ; ] ) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Southwest Finland. Turku, as a town, was settled during the 13th century and founded most likely at the end of the 13th century, making it the oldest city in Finland. It quickly became the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years. After Finland became part of the Russian Empire (1809) and the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812), Turku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains a regional capital and an important business and cultural center.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. Along with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.\nDue to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.\nAs of 31 December 2016, the population of Turku was 187,564, making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 318,168 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n", "text": "The Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects. The Swedish word for \"market place\" is torg, and was probably borrowed from Old East Slavic, and was present already in Old Swedish.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). As this pattern does not appear in any other Swedish place names in Finland, etymologists believe there could be a different explanation. One theory is that it comes from \"Aabo\", the Finnish rendition of the Russian \"Avram\" (Abraham), which could also be the origin of the name of the river Aura. There is however an old legal term called \"\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown.\nIn Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age, the town of Turku was founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering the then eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which almost completely destroyed the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices , among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor. \nAs for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward. \nThere are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000 , the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts. \nAs many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of , whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is . Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only . The average air pressure at sea level is , with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of at Turku Airport.\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.\n89.4% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.2% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.3%), Arabic (0.6%), Albanian (0.5%). 95.8% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council. \nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\ns of June 2015 , over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June\u2019s numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men\u2019s unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women\u2019s 9.4 percent.\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nTurku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009-2010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1.

The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) ( , ), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.\nRail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.\nThe State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.\nThe Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long distance buses.\nTurku Airport is located to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824.

The Seminole tribe had larger clusters of population in other areas of Central Florida, such as nearby Lake Jesup.\nThe population remained sparse until after the American Civil War, when people devastated by war starting moving South to begin a new life. One mile to the southeast side of Lake Jesup, a small hamlet of settlers established the \"Lake Jesup Settlement\" in 1875. Letters from that era showcased a difficult life for the Florida Cracker settlers: cooking outdoors with wood stoves, sleeping under mosquito nets, and burning rags to keep the insects away. Wildlife \nwas plentiful, however. Initially, this settlement had around 40 families, but quickly evolved into a thriving trading port. The settlement was named \"Oviedo\" by Andrew Aulin when the first post office was established to honor the state's Spanish heritage.\nSeveral people played a prominent role in establishing Oviedo's history. George Powell was an early settler who ran a large tract of land, referred to as the \"Powell Settlement\", which today encompasses most of the northern part of the city\u2014including the downtown area. One of Powell's sons, Lewis Powell, (alias Lewis Payne), became infamous for being John Wilkes Booth's primary accomplice in the plot to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln.\nGeorge Powell's friend, Dr. Henry Foster, was instrumental in transforming Oviedo's citrus and celery industry from obscurity to prominence by giving Oviedo reliable transportation to deliver its goods. He paid for a railway link to Oviedo and founded the Lake Jesup Steamboat Company. Agriculture was Oviedo's primary industry all the way through the 1940s. Dr. Foster was also responsible for establishing the Lake Charm area as a resort to entice visitors from the North to vacation in the winter. Dr. Foster encouraged settlers to begin attending regular church services on a site of the \"Powell Settlement\" that would become the First Methodist Church of Oviedo.\nA citrus-grower named Butler Boston is also credited for helping establish Oviedo's citrus economy by successfully grafting tangerine budwood to grow tangerines, as well as budding the succulent Temple orange from Jamaica to several Oviedo fields. Butler Boston was the son of an African-American doctor who moved to Oviedo in 1871 to both set up a medical practice and buy a farm. His father gave the land to his son after a freeze when he moved back to Georgia. Boston was so successful that he was hired to bud other Oviedo fields. He became a spokesman for the large black community in the area, and was especially devoted to improving their educational opportunities, and served as a local school trustee. He was also an accomplished bricklayer and oversaw the planning and construction of a new building for the Antioch Baptist Church. His legacy is noted today throughout Oviedo, in sites such as Boston Street, Boston Alley, Boston Cemetery, Boston Hill and Butler Boston Court. His home site is where Canterbury Retreat and Conference Center is located. Its centerpiece is Lake Gem, named by the Boston family for a close family member.\nAndrew Duda Sr., a Slovak immigrant, established a farm in nearby Slavia in the early 20th century. He left after failing to produce successful crops, but saved up money and returned in 1926 to try again. The second time, he was extraordinarily successful and his farm survived even through the Great Depression. In fact, in 1939, he was able to build St. Luke's Lutheran Church, which has since expanded into a large Lutheran community. The Duda family started a sod division in the 1970s that has since flourished and continues today. The west entrance of Oviedo cuts straight through the sod farm.\nOviedo experienced a major growth spurt during the boom years of the 1920s, and new buildings and banks were built on the main street of downtown, named \"Broadway\". Some of these buildings still remain, along with the complex of buildings surrounding the Nelson and Co. packing house, which was the center of Oviedo's agricultural industry for decades. This agricultural complex eventually shut down for good during the 1980s after a series of winter freezes. At that time, commercial development had already replaced agriculture as Oviedo's main industry.\nOviedo made the transition from a rural hamlet, to a town, and then, in 1967, became a city through a special referendum. Five miles south of Oviedo, in 1963, residents learned about the impending building of a \"space university\" in the Orlando Morning Sentinel. Many faculty and staff members of Florida Technological University (now the University of Central Florida) moved into Oviedo, and new businesses and industry soon followed. The adjacent Central Florida Research Park, originally established in 1978, has since become the largest research park in Florida. This has resulted in an exploding population with many new developments in recent years. As the city has grown, its animals have remained a part of the city's character. Although hogs can no longer be seen walking free, chickens and roosters continue to roam the downtown area and have become an Oviedo attraction.\nMost of the buildings in the downtown historic area were constructed between the end of the 19th and early 20th century. The Nelson and Company Historic District, the R.W. Estes Celery Company Precooler Historic District, the First Methodist Church of Oviedo, and several houses in Oviedo are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The nearby Oviedo Mall features murals of historic areas along with pictures of early European and African-American settlers in the area.\nRoute 434, which cuts through downtown Oviedo, is currently being widened and several buildings have been demolished. The Oviedo Preservation Project has been tasked with photographing and documenting the buildings for posterity.\nAn African-American Oviedo pioneer named Mathew Powell established the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in April 1875.\nAlthough not located in the downtown area, the historic Lake Charm settlement is nearby. This settlement, established by Dr. Henry Foster in the 1860s, became one of the first resorts in Florida. It lasted as a resort until the 1890s. Several winter homes built during that era still stand today.\nIn 2015, the city of Oviedo dedicated a brand new downtown development just south of the current \"old downtown\" along Oviedo Blvd. The new town center, named \"Oviedo on the Park\", is a mixed use development with townhouses, apartment homes, restaurants, and retail. It is centered around the new Center Lake Park with a man-made lake, large amphitheater, playground and Veterans Tribute.\nA 64-bed hospital called the Oviedo Medical Center opened in January, 2017. A new Emergency Room (ER) hospital, called Oviedo ER, was completed in 2014. Oviedo ER is a department of Central Florida Regional Hospital. The Oviedo ER is located on the corner of Red Bug Lake Road and West Broadway.\nThe Oviedo Mall, a single-story indoor mall with a movie theater built in 1998, has recently undergone a large-scale renovation by its new owners, 3D Investments. BJ's Restaurant & Brewery opened across from the Oviedo Mall in August 2014. Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons of the rock group KISS hosted a grand opening celebration for their new Rock & Brews in Oviedo in January 2015. In January 2016, Oviedo's new, expanded Townhouse Restaurant opened a few hundred feet from their old, iconic establishment, which was demolished to make room for the new road project.\nOviedo's new Gym & Aquatic Center features a waterslide, kid's water park, and a large Olympic-sized pool with multiple lanes. Oviedo's Riverside Park also contains a pool, but also in addition has tennis courts and a skate park.\nOviedo also has a YMCA, golf course, county library branch, Little League, bowling/pinball center, a boating complex, and a nature nursery. Several large retailers in Oviedo include Target, Home Depot, and Lowe's amongst others.\nOviedo is also home to numerous housing developments including Alafaya Woods, Whispering Woods, Aloma Woods, Remington Park, Carillon, Little Creek, Sanctuary, Kingsbridge, Riverside, Riverwind Apartments, Twin Rivers, and Bear Creek. Newer subdivisions include Oviedo Forest, Oviedo Gardens, Providence, Clayton's Crossing, Stratford Green, the Trails, Live Oak Reserve, and Aulin's Landing of Oviedo\u2014named after one of the city's founding settlers and first postmaster, Andrew Aulin.\nBlack Hammock Adventures is a complex that offers airboat rides and a display of live gators. Lukas Butterfly Encounter is also located in Oviedo. The Pinball Lounge, located in the Oviedo Bowling Center, has the largest concentration of pinball machines in the state.\nThe \"Oviedo Lights\" is a local roadside attraction. A mural dedicated to the phenomenon is painted on the wall of the local Tijuana Flats.\n\"The Rising\"\nThis annual event is held the last Saturday each October and invites the entire town to travel a 5K route that leads past 10 historic sites, then \"enjoy a homemade pancake breakfast while watching an interactive performance from actors in costume portraying Oviedo's founders, who are back from beyond the grave for one magical weekend.\" This is a kid-friendly event not designed to be scary, but to educate people on the town's history.\nPart of Oviedo's southern charm is the population of chickens that roam the downtown area. There are so many of them roaming the area that traffic often stops as they cross the roads. The chickens have been featured on Oviedo T-shirts and coffee mugs and a poster commemorating one of Oviedo's yearly festivals, \"A Taste of Oviedo.\" An image of a rooster is painted on all welcome signs for roads leading into Oviedo, and many residents have bumper stickers that say, \"I brake for Oviedo's chickens\".\nContrary to what some believe, there are no specific laws or statutes surrounding the chickens, neither for their protection nor for their removal - the latter being something some residents would like to see due to the danger they pose with traffic in the congested town center. For others, however, the chickens add an element of fun.\nThere are City Ordinances that protect birds in the City Limits, the entire city is designated a bird sanctuary. Chickens are afforded the courtesy of protection under the code.\nThe chickens were also the subject of a short documentary that was part of the Florida Film Festival 2009.\nThere are also wild peacocks that roam the downtown area as well.\nThe city of Oviedo's public schools are a part of Seminole County Public Schools. Oviedo contains 6 public elementary schools (K-5); 3 public middle schools (6-8); and 2 public high schools (9-12). The city of Oviedo is also home to a branch of Seminole State College of Florida, the Orlando campus of Reformed Theological Seminary, and borders the University of Central Florida in Orlando.\nThe Seminole Voice and The Seminole Chronicle (publication ceased in July 2014) are both print newspapers that cover Seminole County news, with a focus on the Winter Springs, Oviedo, and Chuluota areas of the county. The Oviedo Voice has covered Oviedo since 1993. The Oviedo Citizen is an online publication that has been covering Oviedo news since August 2008.\nIn August 2004, the northwestern side of Hurricane Charley passed directly over Oviedo while still a Category 2 storm. More than half the city, as well as much of the surrounding unincorporated areas, had no power for five to seven days. School was not in session county-wide for one full school week. The damages ranged from toppled oaks to destroyed homes. The worst damage was in Palm Valley, a mobile home retirement community less than a mile from UCF. Charley's damage in Oviedo is considered to be the worst in Seminole County history. Barely a month later, Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne further battered the area resulting in additional damage and power outages, but they did not reach the level of Charley's fury.\nTropical Storm Fay hung over Oviedo for days during 2008 with high winds, heavy rains, and flooded roads.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 767, "sectionHeading": "Name", "sectionLabel": "city.etymology"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 767, "length": 417, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1184, "length": 1646, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2830, "length": 330, "sectionHeading": "Awards and press", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3160, "length": 5376, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 8536, "length": 1130, "sectionHeading": "Historic downtown", "sectionLabel": "city.district"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 9666, "length": 2196, "sectionHeading": "New developments", "sectionLabel": "city.facility"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 11862, "length": 859, "sectionHeading": "Attractions", "sectionLabel": "city.tourism"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 12721, "length": 1189, "sectionHeading": "Attractions | Oviedo chickens", "sectionLabel": "city.tourism"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 13910, "length": 391, "sectionHeading": "Schools", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 14301, "length": 363, "sectionHeading": "Local publications", "sectionLabel": "city.other"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 14664, "length": 723, "sectionHeading": "Weather events | Hurricane season of 2004", "sectionLabel": "city.other"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 15387, "length": 106, "sectionHeading": "Weather events | Tropical Storm Fay", "sectionLabel": "city.other"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew,_Mississippi", "type": "city", "title": "Drew, Mississippi", "abstract": "Drew is a city in Sunflower County, Mississippi.

The city anchors the Las Vegas Valley metropolitan area and is the largest city within the greater Mojave Desert. Las Vegas is an internationally renowned major resort city, known primarily for its gambling, shopping, fine dining, entertainment, and nightlife. The Las Vegas Valley as a whole serves as the leading financial, commercial, and cultural center for Nevada.\nThe city bills itself as The Entertainment Capital of the World, and is famous for its mega casino\u2013hotels and associated activities. It is a top three destination in the United States for business conventions and a global leader in the hospitality industry, claiming more AAA Five Diamond hotels than any other city in the world. Today, Las Vegas annually ranks as one of the world's most visited tourist destinations. The city's tolerance for numerous forms of adult entertainment earned it the title of Sin City, and has made Las Vegas a popular setting for literature, films, television programs, and music videos.\nLas Vegas was settled in 1905 and officially incorporated in 1911. At the close of the 20th century, it was the most populated American city founded within that century (a similar distinction earned by Chicago in the 1800s). Population growth has accelerated since the 1960s, and between 1990 and 2000 the population nearly doubled, increasing by 85.2%. Rapid growth has continued into the 21st century, and according to a 2013 estimate, the population is 603,488 with a regional population of 2,027,828.\n\"Las Vegas\" is often used to describe areas beyond official city limits\u2014especially the areas on and near the Las Vegas Strip, which is actually located within the unincorporated communities of Paradise, Winchester, and Enterprise.\n", "text": "Perhaps the earliest visitors to the Las Vegas area were nomadic Paleo-Indians, who traveled there 10,000 years ago, leaving behind petroglyphs. Anasazi and Paiute tribes followed at least 2,000 years ago.\nA young Mexican scout named Rafael Rivera is credited as the first non-Native American to encounter the valley, in 1829. Trader Antonio Armijo led a 60-man party along the Spanish Trail to Los Angeles, California in 1829. The area was named Las Vegas, which is Spanish for \"the meadows,\" as it featured abundant wild grasses, as well as the desert spring waters needed by westward travelers. The year 1844 marked the arrival of John C. Fr\u00e9mont, whose writings helped lure pioneers to the area. Downtown Las Vegas's Fremont Street is named after him.\nEleven years later members of the LDS Church chose Las Vegas as the site to build a fort halfway between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, where they would travel to gather supplies. The fort was abandoned several years afterward. The remainder of this Old Mormon Fort can still be seen at the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Washington Avenue.\nLas Vegas was founded as a city in 1905, when of land adjacent to the Union Pacific Railroad tracks were auctioned in what would become the downtown area. In 1911, Las Vegas was incorporated as a city.\n1931 was a pivotal year for Las Vegas. At that time, Nevada legalized casino gambling and reduced residency requirements for divorce to six weeks. This year also witnessed the beginning of construction on nearby Hoover Dam. The influx of construction workers and their families helped Las Vegas avoid economic calamity during the Great Depression. The construction work was completed in 1935.\nIn 1941, the Las Vegas Army Air Corps Gunnery School was established. Currently known as Nellis Air Force Base, it is home to the aerobatic team called the Thunderbirds.\nFollowing World War II, lavishly decorated hotels, gambling casinos, and big-name entertainment became synonymous with Las Vegas.\nIn the 1950s the Moulin Rouge opened and became the first racially integrated casino-hotel in Las Vegas.\nIn 1951, nuclear weapons testing began at the Nevada Test Site, northwest of Las Vegas. City residents and visitors were able to witness the mushroom clouds (and were exposed to the fallout) until 1963, when the limited Test Ban Treaty required that nuclear tests be moved underground.\nThe iconic \"Welcome to Las Vegas\" sign, which was never located in the city, was created in 1959 by Betty Willis.\nDuring the 1960s, corporations and business powerhouses such as Howard Hughes were building and buying hotel-casino properties. Gambling was referred to as \"gaming\" which transitioned into legitimate business.\nThe year 1995 marked the opening of the Fremont Street Experience in Las Vegas's downtown area. This canopied five-block area features 12.5 million LED lights and 550,000 watts of sound from dusk until midnight during shows held on the top of each hour.\nDue to the realization of many revitalization efforts, 2012 was dubbed \"The Year of Downtown.\" Hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of projects made their debut at this time. They included The Smith Center for the Performing Arts and DISCOVERY Children's Museum, Mob Museum, Neon Museum, a new City Hall complex and renovations for a new Zappos.com corporate headquarters in the old City Hall building.\nLas Vegas is situated within Clark County in a basin on the floor of the Mojave Desert and is surrounded by mountain ranges on all sides. Much of the landscape is rocky and arid with desert vegetation and wildlife. It can be subjected to torrential flash floods, although much has been done to mitigate the effects of flash floods through improved drainage systems.\nThe peaks surrounding Las Vegas reach elevations of over , and act as barriers to the strong flow of moisture from the surrounding area. The elevation is approximately above sea level. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.03%) is water.\nNevada is the third most seismically active state in the U.S. (after Alaska and California); it has been estimated by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) that over the next 50 years there is a 10\u201320% chance of a M6.0 or greater earthquake occurring within 50 km of Las Vegas.\nWithin the city there are many lawns, trees and other greenery. Due to water resource issues, there has been a movement to encourage xeriscapes. Another part of conservation efforts is scheduled watering days for residential landscaping. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant in 2008 funded a program that analyzed and forecast growth and environmental impacts through the year 2019.\nLas Vegas has a subtropical hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: BWh), typical of the Mojave Desert in which it lies. This climate is typified by long, very hot summers; warm transitional seasons; and short, mild to chilly winters. There is abundant sunshine throughout the year, with an average of 310 sunny days and bright sunshine occurring during 86% of all daylight hours. Rainfall is scarce, with an average of dispersed between roughly 26 to 27 total rainy days per year. Las Vegas is among the sunniest, driest, and least humid locations in all of North America, with exceptionally low dew points and humidity that sometimes remains below 10%.\nThe summer months of June through September are very hot, though moderated by extremely low humidity. July is the hottest month with an average daytime high of . On average, 134 days per year reach or exceed , of which 74 days reach and 7 days reach . During the peak intensity of summer, overnight lows frequently remain above and occasionally above . While most summer days are consistently hot, dry, and cloudless, the North American Monsoon sporadically interrupts this pattern and brings more cloud cover, thunderstorms, lightning, increased humidity, and brief spells of heavy rain to the area. The window of opportunity for the monsoon to affect Las Vegas usually falls between July and August, although this is inconsistent and varies considerably in its impact from year to year.\nLas Vegas winters are short and generally very mild, with chilly (but rarely cold) daytime temperatures. Like all seasons, sunshine during the winter is abundant. December is both the coolest and cloudiest month of the year, with an average daytime high of and sunshine occurring during 78% of its daylight hours. Winter evenings are defined by clear skies and swift drops in temperature after sunset, with overnight lows sinking to or lower during the majority of nights in December and January. Owing to its elevation that ranges from 2,000 feet to 3,000 feet, Las Vegas experiences markedly cooler winters than other areas of the Mojave Desert and the adjacent Sonoran Desert that are closer to sea level. Consequently, the city records freezing temperatures an average of 16 nights per winter. However, it is exceptionally rare for temperatures to ever fall to or below , or for temperatures to remain below for an entire day. Most of the annual precipitation falls during the winter months, but even the wettest month (February) averages only four days of measurable rain. The mountains immediately surrounding the Las Vegas Valley accumulate snow every winter, but significant or sustained accumulation of any kind within the city itself is rare. The most recent major event occurred on December 16, 2008, when Las Vegas received . \nAccording to the 2010 Census, the racial composition of Las Vegas was as follows:\n- White: 62.1% (Non-Hispanic Whites: 47.9%; Hispanic Whites: 14.2%)\n- Black or African American: 11.1%\n- Asian: 6.1% (3.3% Filipino, 0.7% Chinese, 0.5% Korean, 0.4% Japanese, 0.4% Indian, 0.2% Vietnamese, 0.2% Thai)\n- Two or more races: 4.9%\n- Native American: 0.7%\n- Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander: 0.6%\nSource:\nThe city's most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic Whites, have proportionally declined from 72.1% of the population in 1990 to 47.9% in 2010, even as total numbers of all ethnicities have increased with the population. Hispanics or Latinos of any race make up 31.5% of the population. Of those 24.0% are of Mexican, 1.4% of Salvadoran, 0.9% of Puerto Rican, 0.9% of Cuban, 0.6% of Guatemalan, 0.2% of Peruvian, 0.2% of Colombian, 0.2% of Honduran and 0.2% of Nicaraguan descent.\nHawaiians and Las Vegans sometimes refer to Las Vegas as the \"ninth island of Hawaii\" because so many Hawaiians have moved to the city.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 583,756 people, 211,689 households, and 117,538 families residing in the city. The population density was .

About 6.6% of families and 8.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.4% of those under age 18 and 6.3% of those age 65 or over.\nAccording to a 2004 study, Las Vegas has one of the highest divorce rates. The city's high divorce rate is not wholly due to Las Vegans themselves getting divorced. Since divorce is easier in Nevada than most other states, many people come from across the country for the easier process. Similarly, Nevada marriages are notoriously easy to get. Las Vegas has one of the highest marriage rates of U.S. cities, with many licenses issued to people from outside the area (see Las Vegas weddings).\nThe primary drivers of the Las Vegas economy are tourism, gaming and conventions, which in turn feed the retail and restaurant industries.\nThe major attractions in Las Vegas are the casinos and the hotels, although in recent years other new attractions have begun to emerge.\nMost casinos in the downtown area are located on the Fremont Street Experience, The Stratosphere being one of the exceptions. Fremont East, adjacent to the Fremont Street Experience, was granted variances to allow bars to be closer together, similar to the Gaslamp Quarter of San Diego, the goal being to attract a different demographic than the Strip attracts.\nThe Golden Gate Hotel & Casino, located downtown along the Fremont Street Experience, is the oldest continuously operating hotel and casino in Las Vegas; it opened in 1906 as the Hotel Nevada.\nThe year 1931 marked the opening of the Northern Club (now the La Bayou). The most notable of the early casinos may have been Binion's Horseshoe (now Binion's Gambling Hall and Hotel) while it was run by Benny Binion.\nBoyd Gaming has a major presence downtown operating the California Hotel & Casino, Fremont Hotel & Casino and the Main Street Casino.

The Kalamazoo name comes from a Potawatomi word, first found in a British report in 1772. However, the Kalamazoo River, which passes through the modern city of Kalamazoo, was located on the route between Detroit and Fort Saint-Joseph (nowadays Niles, Michigan). French-Canadian traders, missionaries, and military personnel were quite familiar with this area during the French era and thereafter. The name for the Kalamazoo River was then known by Canadians and French as La rivi\u00e8re Kikanamaso. The name \"Kikanamaso\" was also recorded by Father Pierre Potier, a Jesuit missionary for the Huron-Wendats at the Assumption mission (south shore of Detroit), while en route to Fort Saint-Joseph during the fall of 1760. Legend has it that \"Ki-ka-ma-sung,\" meaning \"boiling water,\" referring to a footrace held each fall by local Native Americans, who had to run to the river and back before the pot boiled. Still another theory is that it means \"the mirage or reflecting river.\" Another legend is that the image of \"boiling water\" referred to fog on the river as seen from the hills above the current downtown. The name was also given to the river that flows almost all the way across the state.\nThe name Kalamazoo, which sounds unusual to English-speaking ears, has become a metonym for exotic places, as in the phrase \"from Timbuktu to Kalamazoo.\" Today, T-shirts are sold in Kalamazoo with the phrase \"Yes, there really is a Kalamazoo.\"\nThe area on which the modern city of Kalamazoo stands was once home to Native Americans of the Hopewell culture, who migrated into the area sometime before the first millennium.

The Potawatomi culture lived in the area when the first European explorers arrived.\nRen\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, passed just southeast of the present city of Kalamazoo in late March 1680.

There are records of several traders wintering in the area, and by the 1820s at least one trading post had been established.\nDuring the War of 1812, the British established a smithy and a prison camp in the area.\nThe 1821 Treaty of Chicago ceded the territory south of the Grand River to the United States federal government. However, the area around present-day Kalamazoo was reserved as the village of Potawatomi Chief Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish. Six years later, as a result of the 1827 Treaty of St. Joseph, the tract that became the city of Kalamazoo was also ceded.\nIn 1829, Titus Bronson, originally from Connecticut, became the first white settler to build a cabin within the present city limits of Kalamazoo. He platted the town in 1831 and named it the village of Bronson\u2014not to be confused with the much smaller Bronson, Michigan, about to the south-southeast of Kalamazoo.\nBronson, frequently described as \"eccentric\" and argumentative, was later run out of town. The village was renamed Kalamazoo in 1836, due in part to Bronson's being fined for stealing a cherry tree. Today, a hospital and a downtown park, among other things, are named for Bronson. Kalamazoo was legally incorporated as a village in 1838 and as a city in 1883.\nThe fertile farmlands attracted prosperous Yankee farmers who settled the surrounding area, and sent their sons to Kalamazoo to become businessmen, professionals and entrepreneurs who started numerous factories.

It was on the original Territorial Road in Michigan of the 19th century, which started in Detroit and ran to Lake Michigan. Much of that, but not all, later became Old US 12\u2014the \"old\" designation came about when I-94 was built parallel to it\u2014and also was called Red Arrow Highway after a World War I army division. The name \"US 12\" was shifted south to what once was US 112 between Detroit and New Buffalo . Some parts of Old US 12 outside of town, especially in Van Buren and Berrien counties to the west, are still called Red Arrow Highway. The term \"Old US 12\" has faded from use.\nThe Kal-Haven Trail, heavily used by cyclists, runners, walkers, and snowmobilers, extends to downtown Kalamazoo. It runs between South Haven, Michigan, to a trailhead just west of Kalamazoo. Between that trailhead and South Haven the trail is run by Van Buren County, even the parts within Kalamazoo County. A trail pass is no longer required. The Kal-Haven is a rail trail, built on the former right-of-way of the Kalamazoo and South Haven Railroad.\nThe section east of the trailhead was opened in 2008 and extends to downtown Kalamazoo. It's known as the Kalamazoo River Valley Trail and is run by Kalamazoo County. No pass is required on that section.\nKalamazoo's name is a familiar reference in popular music, since its exotic sound makes it a \"great word for a lyric\". Its use as metonym for a remote place is discussed above \"although when it comes to both Timbuktu and Kalamazoo, most of that brag-worthy exotic allure is merely in their names.\" Nonetheless, numerous songs use the city's name in their song title or lyrics.\nProbably the most famous and first was (I've Got a Gal In) Kalamazoo\" (1942) by the Glenn Miller band with Tex Beneke. This #1 popular song was written by Mack Gordon and Harry Warren. The performance was recreated with Gene Morrison Orchestra as the Glenn Miller Band and the Nicholas Brothers (doing a memorable dance) in the 1942 movie Orchestra Wives. This was nominated: Best Music, Original Song in Academy Awards) Harry Warren (music), Mack Gordon (lyrics). See 15th Academy Awards.\nAt least a dozen (and many more versions) of \"Kalamazoo\" songs have been recorded. In chronological order others include: \"I've Been Everywhere\" by Hank Snow (1962) (album of the same title) and Johnny Cash (1996) Unchained reworked from the original 1959 Geoff Mack Australian-place-names version made popular by the singer Lucky Starr; \"Down on the Corner\" (1969) by Creedence Clearwater Revival on their fourth studio album, Willy and the Poor Boys covered by a dozen other groups though the reference is not to the city but to one of the \"Kalamazoo\" line of budget priced guitars manufactured by Gibson; \"Kalamazoo\" (1995) by Luna on Penthouse; \"Cold Rock a Party\" (1997) by MC Lyte on Bad As I Wanna B; \"Kalamazoo\" a song by the rock trio Primus on the 1997 Brown Album'; \"Top of the World\" by Rascalz (1999) on Global Warning; \"Kalamazoo\", a song by Ben Folds on the 2004 EP Super D; and \"Kalamazoo\" (2009) by Mike Craver on his album Shining Down. The city was also mentioned in the chorus of the song \"Gotta Get Away\" by The Black Keys, from their album Turn Blue (\"I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo/Just to get away from you...\"). Like Miller, the Creedence and Axton lyrics probably use the word \"Kalamazoo\" as an oblique reference to Gibson Guitars, which made various models named \"Kalamazoo\", all prominently adorned with the city's name as their origin. Rapper Young Jeezy also referenced the city in the song \"Higher Learning\" on his third album \"TM103:Hustlerz Ambition\".\nThe \"Kalamazoo\" was one of several names of a railroad Handcar, and was produced by the Kalamazoo Manufacturing Company.\nThe city of Kalamazoo, Michigan has three sister cities.\n- Kingston, Jamaica\n- Numazu, Japan\n- Pushkin, Russia\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 1625, "sectionHeading": "Name origin", "sectionLabel": "city.etymology"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1625, "length": 2945, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4570, "length": 1478, "sectionHeading": "History | Economic history", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6048, "length": 1115, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7163, "length": 477, "sectionHeading": "Climate", "sectionLabel": "city.climate"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7640, "length": 386, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 8026, "length": 1173, "sectionHeading": "Demographics | 2010 census", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 9199, "length": 372, "sectionHeading": "Neighborhoods", "sectionLabel": "city.district"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 9571, "length": 376, "sectionHeading": "Economy", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 9947, "length": 1372, "sectionHeading": "Economy | Breweries", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 11319, "length": 215, "sectionHeading": "Economy | Distilleries", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 11534, "length": 508, "sectionHeading": "Economy | Flavorings", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 12042, "length": 1425, "sectionHeading": "Economy | Life sciences", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 13467, "length": 438, "sectionHeading": "Economy | Industrial design", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 13905, "length": 1181, "sectionHeading": "Economy | Research and economic development", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 15086, "length": 907, "sectionHeading": "Economy | Businesses", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 15993, "length": 793, "sectionHeading": "Government", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 16786, "length": 622, "sectionHeading": "Crime", "sectionLabel": "city.crime"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 17408, "length": 2046, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 19454, "length": 2226, "sectionHeading": "Culture", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 21680, "length": 841, "sectionHeading": "Culture | Animation festival", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 22521, "length": 702, "sectionHeading": "Culture | Museums", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 23223, "length": 620, "sectionHeading": "Culture | Music", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 23843, "length": 2625, "sectionHeading": "Sports", "sectionLabel": "city.sport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 26468, "length": 404, "sectionHeading": "Local media | Newspapers", "sectionLabel": "city.media"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 26872, "length": 1509, "sectionHeading": "Local media | Television", "sectionLabel": "city.media"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 28381, "length": 2981, "sectionHeading": "Local media | Radio", "sectionLabel": "city.media"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 31362, "length": 645, "sectionHeading": "Transportation | Highways", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 32007, "length": 656, "sectionHeading": "Transportation | Other", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 32663, "length": 2478, "sectionHeading": "In popular culture", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 35141, "length": 111, "sectionHeading": "Sister cities", "sectionLabel": "city.international_affairs"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma,_Arkansas", "type": "city", "title": "Alma, Arkansas", "abstract": "Alma is a city in Crawford County, Arkansas, United States.

The town has had various statues of the cartoon character Popeye, because of his connection to canned spinach; the most recent one was erected in 2007. Cast in bronze, it sits atop a fountain holding a can of spinach. It is the centerpiece of Popeye Park. Crystal City Texas is also considered the Spinach Capital of the World.\nThe annual Spinach Festival is hosted at the City Park and Community Center on the third weekend in April.

North of Destin, across the bay is Niceville, with the Mid-Bay Bridge linking the two by road. Panama City (to the east) and Pensacola (to the west) are each about away.\nAt the western tip of the peninsula is East Pass (also known as Destin Pass), separating it from Santa Rosa Island to the west. East Pass is the only outlet of Choctawhatchee Bay into the Gulf of Mexico, Many sources claim that the current pass was dug by hand with an inrush of water widening it within hours. The early pass appears (at the East end of Destin Harbor) in early maps and surveys from Spanish, French, and English surveyors, such as Thomas Jefferys's 1775 map The Coast of West Florida and Louisiana. Frequent dredging is required to keep East Pass navigable.\n\"Crab Island,\" was actually two islands made from sand that the Army Corps of Engineers dredged up from the East Pass.

Visitors can charter fishing vessels from the harbor, and there are 12 beach access points in the city. Among the access points is Henderson Beach State Recreation Area. A portion of the Gulf Islands National Seashore, the Okaloosa Day Use Area, is just across East Pass on Santa Rosa Island.\nThe sand on Destin's beaches is some of the whitest in the world. The sand comes from the Appalachian Mountains, and is made of finely ground quartz crystal giving the appearance of sugar. Residue flows down the Apalachicola River and is deposited into the Gulf of Mexico. Because of the currents the sand drifts west along the Gulf Coast and settles from east of Panama City to the Alabama coast.\nSeveral events also take place throughout the year as well. For the month of October, the annual Destin Fishing Rodeo draws anglers to Destin each year since 1948. Also in the month of October is the Destin Seafood Festival, where fresh seafood and local artists gather for one weekend every October.\nIn addition to an assortment of hotels and motels, many high-rise condominiums are located in Destin.

It was said that Butch Cassidy later came back to Helper for occasional visits.\nAdjacent to Helper was Spring Glen. It was first established in 1880, with Teancum Pratt being one of the first settlers. An LDS branch was organized there in 1885 with Francis Marion Ewell as president. It was made a ward in 1889. As of 1930 less than 20% of the population in Spring Glen was LDS.\nHelper's growth proceeded in a slow but deliberate fashion bearing little resemblance to booming metal-mining towns. The first amenities offered the few settlers and numerous railroad workers included three saloons, one grocery store, and one clothing establishment. A school was built in 1891. By 1895 the D&RGW buildings and shops at Helper were lighted by electricity, and two reservoirs for water had been constructed.\nEthnic diversity was destined to become a chief characteristic of Helper. Industrial expansion, coal mining, and railroading required a great amount of unskilled labor. In 1894 the railroad's passenger department established an immigration bureau to advertise Utah Territory. This move coincided with the influx of the numerous immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and from Asia.\nChinese laborers were brought in at an early date to work the Carbon County mines and railroads. By the late 1890s, Italians and Austrians (primarily Slovenians, Croatians, and Serbians) began to arrive. In 1900 Helper's population was listed at 385 people. Sixteen different nationality groups were represented. \"Merchant\" and \"laborer\" comprised most of the occupations for these early immigrants.\nAfter the unsuccessful coal miners' strike of 1903-04, Italians, blacklisted from the mines at nearby Castle Gate, ventured into Helper to establish businesses and farms along the Price River. The influx of strikers into Helper accelerated its growth, with the newly established farms offering needed agricultural products.\nThe twentieth century was launched in Carbon County (which had been formed in 1894 from Emery County) in a shroud of uncertainty, largely due to the strike situation. Greek and Japanese immigrants were brought in to break the strike, and thus new ethnic groups came onto the scene. Helper, along with Price, was fast becoming the center of the Carbon County coalfields, providing service functions to the outlying camps. A 1903-04 business directory listed sixteen separate businesses in Helper; by 1912-13 the number had grown to twenty-nine, with a population of about 850. Helper townsite was regularly organized and incorporated in 1907 with a president of the town board and members of the board serving the community.\nBy 1914-15 there were 71 businesses listed for Helper, with 84 in 1918-19, and 157 for the years 1924-25. Many of Helper's business enterprises were associated with specific ethnic groups, but this fact illustrated the business opportunities then available in the town, enabling immigrants to \"break the ranks of labor.\" Italian and Chinese-owned businesses were joined in the 1910s and 1920s by Slavic, Greek, and Japanese establishments. Specialty shops, cafes, coffeehouses, saloons, theaters, general mercantiles, and various service-oriented businesses formed Helper's commercial district. Some ventures, such as the Mutual Mercantile Company, were joint operations between different ethnic groups.\nEthnic identities, the existence of both inter- and intra-group rivalries, new waves of immigration, and Helper's position as a neutral ground for labor influenced the town's social landscape. Helper became known as the area \"hub\" because it was nestled among various mining camps, and it served as a city of refuge where strikers and union organizers as well as national guardsmen could congregate during tense times. Customs and lifestyles associated with various ethnic groups continued; however, through interaction many eventually were changed and modified in the Helper environment.\nWhile the Great Depression hit the entire county, Helper's position as a railroad center provided some stability. Helper's city hall had been built in 1927, and a civic auditorium was constructed in 1936. The D&RGW developed \"bridge traffic,\" acquiring trade from other major roads that wanted transcontinental connections.\nCoal production increased during World War II and continued strong through the 1960s, although with significant periods of uncertainty and temporary decline. Not all of the communities surrounding Helper were able to weather these difficult periods of economic instability, and the town is within a few miles of a large number of former coal mining settlements that were abandoned between the 1930s and 1970s, and are now ghost towns. These towns include Castle Gate, Coal City, Consumers, National, Peerless, Rains, Royal, and Standardville.\nUpturns and downswings plagued the industry in the 1970s, with new lows reached in the 1980s and early 1990s. Helper continues to ride the tide of these fluctuations and, as any town influenced by the mining industry, seeks to survive during bad economic times.\nHelper was named the top western town for 2006 by the True West Magazine, in the January/February 2007 issue.\nApproach of the compliance date of April 16, 2015, for enhanced EPA controls on emission of mercury resulted in a decision by Rocky Mountain Power, a subsidiary of PacifiCorp, to close down the Carbon power plant in Helper on April 14, 2015. It had been in operation since 1954.\nHelper is situated at the mouth of Price Canyon, alongside the Price River, on the eastern side of the Wasatch Plateau in Central Utah. Trains traveling westward from the Price side to the Salt Lake City side of the plateau required additional \"helper\" engines in order to make the steep (2.4% grade) climb up Price Canyon to the town of Soldier Summit. Helper was named after these helper engines, which the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad stationed in the city.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.8 square miles (4.6 km\u00b2), all of it land.\nThis climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification system, Helper has a humid continental climate, abbreviated \"Dfb\" on climate maps.\nAs of the U.S. Census of 2000, there were 2,025 people, 814 households, and 559 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,132.7 people per square mile (436.8/km\u00b2). There were 925 housing units at an average density of 517.4 per square mile (199.5/km\u00b2).

The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females there were 98.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.8 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $30,052, and the median income for a family was $37,266. Males had a median income of $32,708 versus $22,500 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,762. About 11.1% of families and 12.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.3% of those under age 18 and 13.7% of those age 65 or over.\nHelper has two schools that belong to the Carbon School District (Carbon County, Utah). Located in western Helper is its lone elementary school, Sally Mauro Elementary, and located about a half mile east of the elementary school is Helper Middle School.\nAmtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Helper station, operating its California Zephyr daily in both directions between Chicago and Emeryville, California, across the bay from San Francisco. The now defunct Rio Grande Zephyr also stopped at Helper. It also lies along U.S. Route 6/191, which split just north of the city - U.S. 191 heads northeast to Duchesne, while U.S. 6 heads northwest to Spanish Fork. Both continue together southeast to I-70 just west of Green River.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 5952, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5952, "length": 279, "sectionHeading": "History | Power plant closure", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6231, "length": 471, "sectionHeading": "History | Name", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6702, "length": 119, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6821, "length": 293, "sectionHeading": "Geography | Climate", "sectionLabel": "city.climate"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7114, "length": 1635, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 8749, "length": 254, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 9003, "length": 499, "sectionHeading": "Infrastructure | Transportation", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamstown,_Kentucky", "type": "city", "title": "Williamstown, Kentucky", "abstract": "Williamstown is a home-rule-class city in Grant and Pendleton counties in the U.S. state of Kentucky.

It is one of two cities in Kentucky designated as first-class, the other being the state's second-largest city of Lexington. Louisville is the historical seat and, since 2003, the nominal seat of Jefferson County.\nLouisville was founded in 1778 by George Rogers Clark and is named after King Louis XVI of France, making Louisville one of the oldest cities west of the Appalachian Mountains. Sited beside the Falls of the Ohio, the only major obstruction to river traffic between the upper Ohio River and the Gulf of Mexico, the settlement first grew as a portage site. It was the founding city of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, which grew into a system across 13 states. Today, the city is known as the home of the Kentucky Derby, Kentucky Fried Chicken, the University of Louisville and its Louisville Cardinals athletic teams, Louisville Slugger baseball bats, and three of Kentucky's six Fortune 500 companies. Its main airport is also the site of United Parcel Service's worldwide air hub.\nSince 2003, Louisville's borders have been the same as those of Jefferson County because of a city-county merger. The official name of this consolidated city-county government is the Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government, abbreviated to Louisville Metro. Despite the merger and renaming, the term \"Jefferson County\" continues to be used in some contexts in reference to Louisville Metro, particularly including the incorporated cities outside the \"balance\" which make up Louisville proper. The city's total consolidated population as of the 2016 census estimate was 765,352. However, the balance total of 616,261 excludes other incorporated places and semiautonomous towns within the county and is the population listed in most sources and national rankings.\nThe Louisville-Jefferson County, KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), sometimes also referred to as Kentuckiana, includes Louisville-Jefferson County and 12 surrounding counties, seven in Kentucky and five in Southern Indiana. As of 2014, the MSA had a population of 1,269,702, ranking 43rd nationally. \n", "text": "The history of Louisville spans hundreds of years, and has been influenced by the area's geography and location.\nThe rapids at the Falls of the Ohio created a barrier to river travel, and as a result, settlements grew up at this stopping point. The first European settlement in the vicinity of modern-day Louisville was on Corn Island in 1778 by Col. George Rogers Clark, credited as the founder of Louisville. Several landmarks in the community are named after him.\nTwo years later, in 1780, the Virginia General Assembly approved the town charter of Louisville. The city was named in honor of King Louis XVI of France, whose soldiers were then aiding Americans in the Revolutionary War. Early residents lived in forts to protect themselves from Indian raids, but moved out by the late 1780s. In 1803, explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark organized their expedition across America in the town of Clarksville, Indiana at the present-day Falls of the Ohio opposite Louisville, Kentucky.\nThe city's early growth was influenced by the fact that river boats had to be unloaded and moved downriver before reaching the falls. By 1828, the population had swelled to 7,000 and Louisville became an incorporated city. The city grew rapidly in its formative years.\nLouisville was a major shipping port and slaves worked in a variety of associated trades. The city was often a point of escape for slaves to the north, as Indiana was a free state.\nDuring the Civil War, Louisville was a major stronghold of Union forces, which kept Kentucky firmly in the Union. It was the center of planning, supplies, recruiting, and transportation for numerous campaigns, especially in the Western Theater. By the end of the war, Louisville had not been attacked, although skirmishes and battles, including the battles of Perryville and Corydon, took place nearby. After Reconstruction, returning Confederate veterans largely took political control of the city, leading to the jibe that Louisville joined the Confederacy after the war was over.\nThe first Kentucky Derby was held on May 17, 1875, at the Louisville Jockey Club track (later renamed Churchill Downs). The Derby was originally shepherded by Meriwether Lewis Clark, Jr., the grandson of William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and grandnephew of the city's founder George Rogers Clark. Horse racing had a strong tradition in Kentucky, whose Inner Bluegrass Region had been a center of breeding high-quality livestock throughout the 19th century. Ten thousand spectators watched the first Derby, which Aristides won.\nOn March 27, 1890, the city was devastated and its downtown nearly destroyed when an F4 tornado tore through as part of the middle Mississippi Valley tornado outbreak. An estimated 74 to 120 people were killed.\nThroughout January 1937, of rain fell in Louisville, and by January 27, the Ohio River crested at a record , almost above flood stage. These events triggered the \"Great Flood of 1937\", which lasted into early February. The flood submerged 60\u201370% of the city, caused complete loss of power for four days, and forced the evacuation of 175,000 or 230,000 residents, depending on sources. Ninety people died as a result of the flood. It led to dramatic changes in where residents lived. Today, the city is protected by numerous flood walls. After the flood, the areas of high elevation in the eastern part of the city had decades of residential growth.\nLouisville was a center for factory war production during World War II. In May 1942, the U.S. government assigned the Curtiss-Wright Aircraft Company, a war plant located at Louisville's air field, for wartime aircraft production. The factory produced the C-46 Commando cargo plane, among other aircraft. In 1946, the factory was sold to International Harvester, which began large-scale production of tractors and agricultural equipment. In 1950, the Census Bureau reported Louisville's population as 84.3% white and 15.6% black.\nSimilar to many other older American cities, Louisville began to experience a movement of people and businesses to the suburbs in the 1960s and 1970s. Middle class residents used newly built freeways and interstate highways to commute to work, moving into more distant but newer housing. Because of tax laws, businesses found it cheaper to build new rather than renovate older buildings. Economic changes included a decline in local manufacturing. The West End and older areas of the South End, in particular, began to decline economically as many local factories closed.\nIn 1974, a major (F4) tornado hit Louisville as part of the 1974 Super Outbreak of tornadoes that struck 13 states. It covered and destroyed several hundred homes in the Louisville area. Only two people died.\nSince the 1980s, many of the city's urban neighborhoods have been revitalized into areas popular with young professionals and college students. The greatest change has occurred along the Bardstown Road/Baxter Avenue and Frankfort Avenue corridors as well as the Old Louisville neighborhood. In recent years, such change has also occurred in the East Market District (NuLu).\nSince the late 1990s, Downtown has experienced significant residential, tourist and retail growth, including the addition of major sports complexes KFC Yum! Center and Louisville Slugger Field, conversion of waterfront industrial sites into Waterfront Park, openings of varied museums (see Museums, galleries and interpretive centers below), and the refurbishing of the former Galleria into the bustling entertainment complex Fourth Street Live!, which opened in 2004.\nLouisville and Jefferson County have a combined area of , of which is land and (4.33%) is covered by water.\nLouisville is southeasterly situated along the border between Kentucky and Indiana, the Ohio River, in north-central Kentucky at the Falls of the Ohio. Although situated in a Southern state, Louisville is influenced by both Southern and Midwestern culture. It is sometimes referred to as either one of the northernmost Southern cities or as one of the southernmost Northern cities in the United States.\nLouisville is located in Kentucky's outer Bluegrass region. Its development has been influenced by its location on the Ohio River, which spurred Louisville's growth from an isolated camp site into a major shipping port. Much of the city is located on a very wide and flat floodplain surrounded by hill country on all sides. Much of the area was swampland that had to be drained as the city grew. In the 1840s, most creeks were rerouted or placed in canals to prevent flooding and disease outbreaks.\nAreas generally east of I-65 are above the flood plain, and are composed of gently rolling hills. The southernmost parts of Jefferson County are in the scenic and largely undeveloped Knobs region, which is home to Jefferson Memorial Forest.\nThe Louisville-Jefferson County, KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), the 43rd largest in the United States, includes the Kentucky county of Jefferson (coterminous with Louisville Metro), plus twelve outlying counties\u2014seven in Kentucky and five in Southern Indiana. Louisville's MSA is included in the Louisville\u2013Elizabethtown\u2013Madison, KY\u2013IN Combined Statistical Area (CSA), which also includes the Elizabethtown, KY MSA, as well as the Madison, IN Micropolitan Statistical Area.\nThe Louisville area is near several other urban areas, especially Frankfort, Kentucky (the state's capital), Cincinnati, Ohio (the two cities' metropolitan statistical areas almost border each other), Lexington, Kentucky, and the Indianapolis, Indiana area (especially Columbus, Indiana, to the north of Southern Indiana).\nThe downtown business district of Louisville is located immediately south of the Ohio River and southeast of the Falls of the Ohio. Major roads extend outwards from the downtown area in all directions, like the spokes of a wheel. The airport is about south of the downtown area. The industrial sections of town are to the south and west of the airport, while most of the residential areas of the city are to the southwest, south, and east of downtown. In 2010, the 22,000-seat KFC Yum! Center was completed. Twelve of the 15 buildings in Kentucky over are located in downtown Louisville.\nAnother primary business and industrial district is located in the suburban area east of the city on Hurstbourne Parkway.\nLouisville's late 19th- and early 20th-century development was spurred by three large suburban parks built at the edges of the city in 1890.\nThe city's architecture contains a blend of old and new. The Old Louisville neighborhood is the largest historic preservation district solely featuring Victorian homes and buildings in the United States; it is also the third-largest such district overall. Many modern skyscrapers are located downtown, as well as older preserved structures, such as the Southern National Bank building. The buildings of West Main Street in downtown Louisville have the largest collection of cast iron facades of anywhere outside of New York's SoHo district.\nSince the mid-20th century, Louisville has in some ways been divided into three sides of town: the West End, the South End, and the East End. In 2003, Bill Dakan, a University of Louisville geography professor, said that the West End, west of 7th Street and north of Algonquin Parkway, is \"a euphemism for the African American part of town\" although he points out that this belief is not entirely true, and most African Americans no longer live in areas where more than 80% of residents are black. Nevertheless, he says the perception is still strong. The South End has long had a reputation as a white, working-class part of town, while the East End has been seen as middle and upper class.\nAccording to the Greater Louisville Association of Realtors, the area with the lowest median home sales price is west of Interstate 65, in the West and South Ends, the middle range of home sales prices are between Interstates 64 and 65 in the South and East Ends, and the highest median home sales price are north of Interstate 64 in the East End. Immigrants from Southeast Asia tend to settle in the South End, while immigrants from Eastern Europe settle in the East End.\nLouisville has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with four distinct seasons and is located in USDA hardiness zones 6b and 7a. Spring-like conditions typically begin in mid-to-late March, summer from mid-to-late-May to late September, with fall in the October\u2013November period. Seasonal extremes in both temperature and precipitation are not uncommon during early spring and late fall; severe weather is not uncommon, with occasional tornado outbreaks in the region. Winter typically brings a mix of rain, sleet, and snow, with occasional heavy snowfall and icing. Louisville averages 4.5 days with low temperatures dipping to ; the first and last freezes of the season on average fall on November 2 and April 5, respectively. Summer is typically hazy, hot, and humid with long periods of temperatures and drought conditions at times. Louisville averages 38 days a year with high temperatures at or above . The mean annual temperature is , with an average annual snowfall of and an average annual rainfall of .\nThe wettest seasons are spring and summer, although rainfall is fairly constant year round. During the winter, particularly in January and February, several days of snow can be expected. January is the coldest month, with a mean temperature of .

Immediately east of downtown is the Big Four Bridge, a former railroad bridge now renovated as a pedestrian bridge.\nThe Ohio River Bridges Project, a plan under consideration for decades to construct two new interstate bridges over the Ohio River to connect Louisville to Indiana, including a reconfiguration of Spaghetti Junction, began construction in 2012. One bridge, the Abraham Lincoln Bridge, is located downtown beside the existing Kennedy Bridge for relief of I-65 traffic. The other, named the Lewis and Clark Bridge, connects I-265 between the portions located in southeast Clark County, Indiana and northeast Jefferson County, Kentucky (Louisville Metro). Both bridges and corresponding construction were finished in 2016. As with any major project, there have been detractors and possible alternatives; one grassroots organization, 8664.org, has proposed options for downtown revitalization improvements, and a simpler and less expensive roadway design.\nLouisville's main airport is the centrally located Louisville International Airport, whose IATA Airport Code (SDF) reflects its former name of Standiford Field. The airport is also home to UPS's Worldport global air hub. UPS operates its largest package-handling hub at Louisville International Airport and bases its UPS Airlines division there. Over 3.2 million passengers and over 4.7 billion pounds (2,350,000 t) of cargo pass through the airport each year. It is also the third busiest airport in the United States in terms of cargo traffic, and seventh busiest for such in the world. Furthermore, since Louisville is located only around 35 minutes from Fort Knox, the airport is a major hub for armed services personnel traveling to and from the military installation. The historic but smaller Bowman Field is used mainly for general aviation while nearby Clark Regional Airport is used mostly by private jets.\nThe McAlpine Locks and Dam is located on the Kentucky side of the Ohio River, near the downtown area. The locks were constructed to allow shipping past the Falls of the Ohio. In 2001 over 55 million tons of commodities passed through the locks.\nPublic transportation consists mainly of buses run by the Transit Authority of River City (TARC). The city buses serve all parts of downtown Louisville and Jefferson County, as well as Kentucky suburbs in Oldham County, Bullitt County, and the Indiana suburbs of Jeffersonville, Clarksville and New Albany. In addition to regular city buses, transit throughout the downtown hotel and shopping districts is served by a fleet of zero-emissions buses called ZeroBus. In late 2014, these vehicles replaced the series of motorized trolleys known as the Toonerville II Trolley. A light rail system has been studied and proposed for the city, but no plan was in development as of 2007.\nLouisville has historically been a major center for railway traffic. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad was once headquartered here, before it was purchased by CSX Transportation. Today the city is served by two major freight railroads, CSX (with a major classification yard in the southern part of the metro area) and Norfolk Southern. Five major main lines connect Louisville to the rest of the region. Two regional railroads, the Paducah and Louisville Railway and the Louisville and Indiana Railroad, also serve the city. With the discontinuance of the stop in Louisville in 2003 for a more northerly route between New York and Chicago, the Kentucky Cardinal no longer serves the city; it is thus the fifth largest city in the country with no passenger rail service.\nIn 2016 Walk Score ranked Louisville 43rd \"most walkable\" of 141 U.S. cities with a population greater than 200,000.\nElectricity is provided to the Louisville Metro area by Louisville Gas & Electric.\nWater is provided by the Louisville Water Company, which provides water to more than 800,000 residents in Louisville as well as parts of Oldham and Bullitt counties. Additionally, they provide wholesale water to the outlying counties of Shelby, Spencer and Nelson.\nThe Ohio River provides for most of the city's source of drinking water. Water is drawn from the river at two points: the raw water pump station at Zorn Avenue and River Road, and the B.E. Payne Pump Station northeast of Harrods Creek. Water is also obtained from a riverbank infiltration well at the Payne Plant. There are also two water treatment plants serving the Louisville Metro area: The Crescent Hill Treatment Plant and the B.E. Payne Treatment Plant. In June 2008, the Louisville Water Company received the \"Best of the Best\" award from the American Water Works Association, citing it as the best-tasting drinking water in the country.\nImportant events occurring in the city have included the first large space lighted by Edison's light bulb which occurred during the Southern Exposition. (At the time, in 1883, the largest such installation to date.) Also, Louisville had the first library open to African Americans in the South, and medical advances including the first human hand transplant and the first self-contained artificial heart transplant.\nLouisville has nine sister cities as of 2012:\nIn addition, Leeds has been recognized as a \"friendship city\". The two cities have engaged in many cultural exchange programs, particularly in the fields of nursing and law, and cooperated in several private business developments, including the Frazier History Museum.\nOn April 15, 2008, it was announced that Louisville would be twinned with the town of Bushmills in Northern Ireland. The two places share a tradition for the distilling of whiskey. The choice of Louisville came after a search of U.S. cities, followed by an online poll conducted for the public to decide between three finalists, which also included Boston and Portland, Maine.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 113, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 113, "length": 881, "sectionHeading": "History | Early history and founding", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 994, "length": 1786, "sectionHeading": "History | 19th century", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2780, "length": 2803, "sectionHeading": "History | 20th and 21st centuries", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5583, "length": 2060, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7643, "length": 2557, "sectionHeading": "Geography | Cityscape", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 10200, "length": 1840, "sectionHeading": "Geography | Climate", "sectionLabel": "city.climate"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 12040, "length": 2076, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 14116, "length": 3161, "sectionHeading": "Demographics | Religion", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 17277, "length": 4691, "sectionHeading": "Economy", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 21968, "length": 2764, "sectionHeading": "Culture | Annual festivals and other events", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 24732, "length": 2209, "sectionHeading": "Culture | Indie scene", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 26941, "length": 4508, "sectionHeading": "Culture | Museums, galleries and interpretive centers", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 31449, "length": 1948, "sectionHeading": "Culture | Performing arts", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 33397, "length": 4153, "sectionHeading": "Culture | Sports", "sectionLabel": "city.sport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 37550, "length": 2522, "sectionHeading": "Parks and outdoor attractions", "sectionLabel": "city.tourism"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 40072, "length": 1901, "sectionHeading": "Government and politics", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 41973, "length": 2110, "sectionHeading": "Government and politics | Public safety and crime", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 44083, "length": 1879, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 45962, "length": 889, "sectionHeading": "Media", "sectionLabel": "city.media"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 46851, "length": 4553, "sectionHeading": "Infrastructure | Transportation", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 51404, "length": 994, "sectionHeading": "Infrastructure | Utilities", "sectionLabel": "city.facility"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 52398, "length": 416, "sectionHeading": "Events", "sectionLabel": "city.other"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 52814, "length": 692, "sectionHeading": "Sister cities", "sectionLabel": "city.international_affairs"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidio,_Texas", "type": "city", "title": "Presidio, Texas", "abstract": "Presidio is a city in Presidio County, Texas, United States.

The population was 4,167 at the 2000 census, and had increased to 4,426 as of the 2010 US census.\nPresidio is on the Farm to Market Road 170, and U.S. Route 67, south of Shafter in Presidio County. Presidio is about 250 miles southeast of El Paso, 240 miles southwest of Odessa, and 145 miles northeast of Chihuahua, Mexico.\n", "text": "The junction of the Rio Conchos and Rio Grande at Presidio was settled thousands of years ago by hunting and gathering peoples. By 1200 CE , the local Native Americans had adopted agriculture and lived in small, closely knit settlements, which the Spaniards later called pueblos. (See La Junta Indians)\nThe first Spaniards came to Presidio in 1535 CE , \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca and his three companions stopped at the Native American pueblo, placed a cross on the mountainside, and called the village La Junta de las Cruces. On December 10, 1582, Antonio de Espejo and his company arrived at the site and called the pueblo San Juan Evangelista. By 1681, the area of Presidio was known as La Junta de los R\u00edos, or the Junction of the Rivers. Five Jumano towns were along the Rio Grande to the north of the junction, consisting largely of permanent houses. In 1683, Juan Sabeata, the chief of the Jumano nation, reported having seen a fiery cross on the mountain at Presidio and requested that a mission be established at La Junta. The settlement in 1684 became known as La Navidad en Las Cruces. The missions La Navidad en las Cruces, San Francisco de los Julimes, San Antonio de los Puliques, Apostol Santiago, and Santa Mar\u00eda de la Redonda may have been established on the Texas side of the Rio Grande at La Junta.\nAbout 1760, a penal colony and military garrison of 60 men were established near Presidio. In 1830, the name of the area around Presidio was changed from La Junta de los Rios to Presidio del Norte. White American settlers came to Presidio in 1848 after the Mexican War. Among them was John Spencer, who operated a horse ranch on the United States side of the Rio Grande near Presidio. Ben Leaton and Milton Faver, former scalp hunters for the Mexican government, built private forts in the area. The handful of Anglo settlers who came to the region were assimilated into the Hispanic population and their descendants are primarily Spanish speakers today. \nDuring the Mexican Revolution, General Pancho Villa often used Ojinaga as his headquarters for operations and visited Presidio on numerous occasions. \nIn 1849, a Comanche raid almost destroyed Presidio, and in 1850, Indians drove off most of the cattle in town. A post office was established at Presidio in 1868, and the first public school was opened in 1887.\nIn 1897, President William McKinley appointed George B. Jackson, an African American former buffalo soldier, as customs collector at Presidio, a position he held until his death in 1900. Jackson, a businessman from San Angelo, was considered the \"wealthiest colored man in Texas\" in the second half of the 19th century.\nIn 1930, the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway reached Presidio, and the town incorporated. The population grew from 96 in 1925 to 1,671 in 1988, but the number of businesses declined from 70 in 1933 to 22 in 1988. At the end of 1988, Presidio experienced a population boom, due in part to previously undocumented immigrants enrolled in the amnesty program. The population in 1990 was 3,422.\nThe 1959 movie Rio Bravo featured the town.\nAs of 2007, Presidio's local economy is based largely upon employment at Presidio Independent School District, United States Customs and Border Protection, and local retail businesses. Formerly, Presidio was home to several truck-farming operations, focused mainly on onions and cantaloupes. Those operations ceased in the late 1990s. \nIn 2010, Presidio built the world's largest sodium-sulfur battery to provide power when the city's lone line to the United States power grid goes down.\nPresidio is located at (29.561272, -104.366522).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Presidio is located near the confluence of the Rio Conchos and the Rio Grande. The Rio Conchos flows in a northeasterly direction from its source in the Sierra Madre in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. Commonly referred to as \"La Junta\" (the joining), the two rivers resulted in plentiful water, creating a flood plain that is ideal for farming.\nAs of the census of 2010, 5,106 people, 1,285 households, and 1,033 families resided in the city. The population density was 1,620.1 people per square mile (626.0/km\u00b2). There were 1,541 housing units at an average density of 599.1 per square mile (231.5/km\u00b2).

The college floundered, however. In 1872 the community suggested that the property be used to educate the less fortunate. In December 1873 the first residents were admitted to the Oxford Orphans Asylum, which is today known as the \"Masonic Home for Children at Oxford\".\nIn 1851 James H. Horner established Horner Military Academy, which served many young men from New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, South Carolina and other states. Many of the students went on to become leaders in the United States government, such as James Crawford Biggs, Solicitor General under President Franklin D.

The school closed the following year.\nIn 1883 the state legislature established the Colored Orphan Asylum in Oxford. Henry Plummer Cheatham, a former US congressman (1889-1893), was appointed superintendent in the early 1900s and led the institution for 28 years.\nIn 1970, Henry Marrow was killed in Oxford. The killing resulted in a racial protest. The events were chronicled by Timothy Tyson in the book Blood Done Sign My Name and a movie with the same name.\nA Confederate statue was erected in 1909 by the Granville Grays United Daughters of the Confederacy at a cost of $3000.00 and valued in 2009 at $1,327,791.62.

The monument, a memorial to the Confederate veterans of Granville County that served in the Civil War in the Granville Grays Company D, 12 Regiment, was dedicated October 30, 1909. The statue had not arrived in time but the ceremony continued and the statue was placed at a later date. \nFollowing the Oxford race riots, in which the movie correctly depicts protesters trying to topple the monument using ropes, the monument was moved in 1971, from the courthouse square to a location in front of the Richard H.

Boaco is called \"Ciudad de Dos Pisos\" (The Two-Storey City), nicknamed by Dr. Armando Incer Barquero. The city's only two flat places are El Parque (Park) and the baseball field.\n", "text": "The name Boaco has its roots in the Zumo and Aztec native languages. It is composed of two words; Boa or Boaj (\"Enchanters\") and the suffix O (\"place\" or \"town\"). In other words, Boaco means \"Place (or Town) of the Enchanters\". The ancient Boaco, or Boaco Viejo (Old Boaco) was located five leagues (15 miles) east of the present-day city of Boaco. No vestiges of the former population remain. It was founded by Spanish colonists who migrated from today's Guatemala. \nIn 1749, the Zambo, Caribe and Mosquito Indians, encouraged by the British colonists on Nicaragua's Atlantic coast, raided Boaco Viejo. They destroyed the town. The few who survived the massacre fled west and founded the new town of Boaco (now known as Boaquito (\"little Boaco\") near the Malacatoya River.\nBetween 1752 and 1772, the population of what was called Boaquito moved to higher ground, where the city of Boaco is today, mainly due to the endemic diseases and flooding that regularly occurred in the lowlands during the rainy season.\nThe municipality of Boaco was traditionally part of the Chontales Department. On February 4, 1910, the government of Jos\u00e9 Madriz established the department of Jerez with the city of Boaco as its capital. However, the conservative government reversed that law. It was not until July 18, 1935 that the government of Juan Bautista Sacasa created the Boaco Department, incorporating the municipalities of Boaco, Camoapa, San Lorenzo, Teustepe, San Jos\u00e9 de los Remates and Santa Luc\u00eda. Boaco was designated the capital of the department.\nBoaco is located in the hilly central region of Nicaragua. Its topography is irregular with many mountains, which are smaller than the mountains in northern Nicaragua.

The average temperature is between 27\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C during summer and 18\u00b0C in December. The annual precipitation is 1,200-2,000 mm.\nElections for municipal authorities are held every four years.

The city has played an important part in Nicaragua's economy, providing pecuarian products (beef, dairy products) to the rest of the country, as well as exporting to other countries.\nWith the help of new paved roads, business from the country's capital of Managua has reached Boaco and stimulated the local economy. Boaco now has casinos, banks, gas stations and its first traffic lights installed.\nThe labour force is about 40% of the population of Boaco, about 23,000, with an unemployment rate of 13%.\nAccording to the 2000 census on education, Boaco has a population of about 31,000 students and 350 teachers (excluding community pre-school workers).\nElementary education (urban area only):\n- Students: 10,000\n- Facilities: 22\nSecondary education (urban area only):\n- Students: 15,000\n- Facilities: 15\nMulti-grade education (rural area only):\n- Students: 10,000\n- Facilities: 308\nCommunity Pre-Schools:\n- Urban area: 2,000 (74 facilities)\n- Rural area: 3,000 (308 facilities)\nThe municipality of Boaco is home to around 1% of Nicaragua's total population.

The site of the fort is about one mile west of the courthouse at the center of town. The name \"Fort Logan\" is still used to this day by local businesses, including the Fort Logan Hospital and Standing Fort Collectibles. The main street was built on what was originally a buffalo trail.\nThe name Stanford may have come from \"Standing Fort\", which Fort Logan became known as because it survived multiple attacks by British-led Native Americans during the American Revolution. Alternately, it may have been named for Stamford, England. Although it was one of the smaller pioneer forts, it never fell to an attack.\nIn 1781, the original settlement expanded when Benjamin Logan donated part of his own land as the site for a courthouse. The county court continued to meet at Fort Harrod (now Harrodsburg) until 1785, when Mercer County was established. By 1786 Stanford had received its charter, making it one of the first towns in the former (1776\u20131780) Kentucky County, Virginia, with a formal charter. In 1787 the courthouse opened in a building made of logs. It has been expanded and upgraded over time, the courthouse remains on the same site. Unlike most courthouses in Kentucky, it has never suffered from a fire or other major loss of records. Lincoln County has all its original records and archives dating from November 1789, making it one of the more complete archives in Kentucky. Among its original land deeds kept on vellum are deeds granting land to both Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton,\nThe first recorded church in Stanford was a Presbyterian church built in 1790, reflecting the staunch Presbyterian beliefs of the Logan family. The building still stands and is now part of the Harvey Helm Memorial Historic Library and Museum on Main Street. Other denominations, including Baptist and Methodist, were not established in the area until the 1830s. The current Presbyterian Church in Stanford has stood on the same site since around 1850.\nA small local library was first established in the 1830s. The library was renamed in 1970 in honor of Harvey Helm, a native son who became a Kentucky statesman and member of the United States House of Representatives between 1909 and 1917.\nThe first school was built sometime in the 1850s, as the Male Academy. It was established in a building that is now the Fox Funeral Home on West Main Street. The corresponding Female Academy was built in the 1870s. The Stanford School was founded in 1900, and after much expansion, still serves, now as the Lincoln County Alternative school.\nLargely untouched by the American Civil War (the nearest conflict was the Battle of Perryville, away), Stanford grew significantly in the post-war period. In the late 1860s, the town gained own newspaper, the Stanford Banner, which is still publishing as the Interior Journal. The city continued to grow, especially after the Louisville and Nashville Railroad built a station and line into the town in late 1865. Now the railroad line has closed, and even the tracks were removed in 1988, leaving only a small spur line that connects to Mount Vernon, Kentucky. However, the railway depot has been restored, and Stanford is notable as the location of the first automobile garage in Kentucky, which opened in 1905.\nStanford is located at (37.532302, \u221284.660358).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 3,430 people, 1,417 households, and 919 families residing in the city.

It is a compound of the Greek adjective, (sebastos, 'venerable') and the noun (p\u00f3lis) ('city'). is the traditional Greek equivalent of the Roman honorific Augustus, originally given to the first emperor of the Roman Empire, Augustus and later awarded as a title to his successors.\nDespite its Greek origin, the name itself is not from Ancient Greek times. The city was probably named after the Empress (\"Augusta\") Catherine II of Russia who founded Sevastopol in 1783. She visited the city in 1787 accompanied by Joseph II, the Emperor of Austria, and other foreign dignitaries.\nIn the west of the city, there are well-preserved ruins of the ancient Greek port city of Chersonesos, founded in the 5th (or 4th) century BC by settlers from Heraclea Pontica. This name means \"peninsula\", reflecting its immediate location, and is not related to the ancient Greek name for the Crimean Peninsula as a whole: Cherson\u0113sos Taurik\u0113 (\"the Taurian Peninsula\").\nThe name of the city is spelled as:\n- In English, the current prevalent spelling of the name is Sevastopol; the previously common spelling Sebastopol is still used by some publications such as The Economist. In English the current spelling has the pronunciation or , whilst the former spelling has the pronunciation or .\n- ; , pronounced ] in Ukrainian and ] in Russian.\n- , pronounced ] .\nIn the 6th century BC a Greek colony was established in the area of the modern-day city. The Greek city of Chersonesus existed for almost two thousand years, first as an independent democracy and later as part of the Bosporan Kingdom. In the 13th and 14th centuries it was sacked by the Golden Horde several times and was finally totally abandoned. The modern day city of Sevastopol has no connection to the ancient and medieval Greek city, but the ruins are a popular tourist attraction located on the outskirts of the city.\nSevastopol was founded in June 1783 as a base for a naval squadron under the name Akhtiar (White Cliff), by Rear Admiral Thomas MacKenzie (Foma Fomich Makenzi), a native Scot in Russian service; soon after Russia annexed the Crimean Khanate. Five years earlier, Alexander Suvorov ordered that earthworks be erected along the harbour and Russian troops be placed there. In February 1784, Catherine the Great ordered Grigory Potemkin to build a fortress there and call it Sevastopol. The realisation of the initial building plans fell to Captain Fyodor Ushakov who in 1788 was named commander of the port and of the Black Sea squadron. It became an important naval base and later a commercial seaport. In 1797, under an edict issued by Emperor Paul I, the military stronghold was again renamed to Akhtiar. Finally, on 29 April (10 May), 1826, the Senate returned the city's name to Sevastopol.\nOne of the most notable events involving the city is the Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u201355) carried out by the British, French, Sardinian, and Turkish troops during the Crimean War, which lasted for 11 months. Despite its efforts, the Russian army had to leave its stronghold and evacuate over a pontoon bridge to the north shore of the inlet. The Russians chose to sink their entire fleet to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy and at the same time to block the entrance of the Western ships into the inlet. When the enemy troops entered Sevastopol, they were faced with the ruins of a formerly glorious city. \nA panorama of the siege originally was created by Franz Roubaud. After its destruction in 1942 during World War II, it was restored and is currently housed in a specially constructed circular building in the city. It portrays the situation at the height of the siege, on 18 June 1855. \nDuring World War II, Sevastopol withstood intensive bombardment by the Germans in 1941\u201342, supported by their Italian and Romanian allies during the Battle of Sevastopol. German forces used railway artillery \u2014 including history's largest-ever calibre railway artillery piece in battle, the 80-cm calibre Schwerer Gustav \u2014 and specialised mobile heavy mortars to destroy Sevastopol's extremely heavy fortifications, such as the Maxim Gorky naval battery. After fierce fighting, which lasted for 250 days, the supposedly untakable fortress city finally fell to Axis forces in July 1942. It was intended to be renamed to \"Theoderichshafen\" (in reference to Theoderic the Great and the fact that the Crimea had been home to Germanic Goths until the 18th or 19th century) in the event of a German victory against the Soviet Union, and like the rest of the Crimea was designated for future colonisation by the Third Reich. It was liberated by the Red Army on 9 May 1944 and was awarded the Hero City title a year later.\nIn 1957, the town of Balaklava was incorporated into Sevastopol.\nDuring the Soviet era, Sevastopol became a so-called \"closed city\". This meant that any non-residents had to apply to the authorities for a temporary permit to visit the city.\nOn 29 October 1948 the Presidium of Supreme Council of the Russian SFSR issued an ukase (order) which confirmed the special status of the city. Soviet academic publications since 1954, including the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, indicated that Sevastopol, Crimean Oblast was part of the Ukrainian SSR (Great Soviet Encyclopedia 1976, Vol.23. pp 104).\nAt the 1955 Ukrainian parliamentary elections on 27 February, Sevastopol was split into two electoral districts, Stalinsky and Korabelny (initially requested three Stalinsky, Korabelny, and Nakhimovsky). Eventually Sevastopol received two people's deputies of the Ukrainian SSR elected to the Verkhovna Rada A.Korovchenko and M.Kulakov.\nOn 10 July 1993, the Russian parliament passed a resolution declaring Sevastopol to be \"a federal Russian city\". At the time, many supporters of the president, Boris Yeltsin, had ceased taking part in the Parliament's work. On 20 July 1993 the United Nations Security Council denounced the decision of the Russia parliament. According to Anatoliy Zlenko, it was for the first time that the council had to review actions and come up with qualification of them for a legislative body.\nOn 14 April 1993, the Presidium of the Crimean Parliament called for the creation of the presidential post of the Crimean Republic. A week later, the Russian deputy, Valentin Agafonov, stated that Russia was ready to supervise the referendum on Crimean independence and include the republic as a separate entity in the CIS. On 28 July 1993, one of the leaders of the Russian Society of Crimea, Viktor Prusakov, stated that his organisation was ready for an armed mutiny and establishment of the Russian administration in Sevastopol. In September, Eduard Baltin accused Ukraine of converting some of his fleet and conducting an armed assault on his personnel, and threatened to take countermeasures of placing the fleet on alert.\nIn May 1997, Russia and Ukraine signed the Peace and Friendship Treaty, ruling out Moscow's territorial claims to Ukraine. A separate agreement established the terms of a long-term lease of land, facilities, and resources in Sevastopol and the Crimea by Russia. \nThe ex-Soviet Black Sea Fleet and its facilities were divided between Russia's Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Naval Forces. The two navies co-used some of the city's harbours and piers, while others were demilitarised or used by either country. Sevastopol remained the location of the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters with the Ukrainian Naval Forces Headquarters also in the city. A judicial row periodically continues over the naval hydrographic infrastructure both in Sevastopol and on the Crimean coast (especially lighthouses historically maintained by the Soviet or Russian Navy and also used for civil navigation support).\nAs in the rest of the Crimea, Russian remained the predominant language of the city, although following the independence of Ukraine there was some attempts at Ukrainisation with very little success. The Russian society in general and even some outspoken government representatives never accepted the loss of Sevastopol and tended to regard it as temporarily separated from the homeland.\nIn July 2009, the chairman of the Sevastopol city council, Valeriy Saratov (Party of Regions) stated that Ukraine should increase the amount of compensation it is paying to the city of Sevastopol for hosting the foreign Russian Black Sea Fleet, instead of requesting such obligations from the Russian government and the Russian Ministry of Defense in particular.\nOn 27 April 2010, Russia and Ukraine ratified the Russian Ukrainian Naval Base for Gas treaty, extending the Russian Navy's lease of Crimean facilities for 25 years after 2017 (through 2042) with an option to prolong the lease in 5-year extensions. The ratification process in the Ukrainian parliament encountered stiff opposition and erupted into a brawl in the parliament chamber. Eventually, the treaty was ratified by a 52% majority vote\u2014236 of 450. The Russian Duma ratified the treaty by a 98% majority without incident.\nOn 20 February 2014, Russian armed forces invaded and seized control over the Crimean peninsula. The city council of Sevastopol reportedly unilaterally declared that it wished to join the Russian Federation as a federal subject. The city council on 11 March released a joint resolution with the Supreme Council of Crimea to unite as an independent republic between the potential passing of the referendum and union with Russia. Ukrainian authorities and the international community strongly criticised the referendum decision. The actions of Russian Federation were qualified by international community as aggression against Ukraine, and occupation of its territory.\nOn 16 March, an unconstitutional referendum on leaving Ukraine took place in the city, along with the rest of Crimea. During the voting the Building of the Supreme Council of Crimea was controlled by the Russian military. The official reports by the organizers of the referendum were that a majority of 95.6% voted to become a part of the Russian Federation, though these results are contested. This referendum resulted in the establishment of the short-lived Republic of Crimea, which consisted of both Sevastopol and Crimea.\nOn 18 March 2014, the treaty on the incorporation of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol to Russia was signed between Russia and the Republic of Crimea, with the following content:\n- The territory of the former Autonomous Republic of Crimea is incorporated as the Republic of Crimea (a Federal subject of Russian Federation).\n- The former Special Status City of Sevastopol is incorporated as a Federal City of Russia.\n- Both territories are incorporated as part of the Crimean Federal District.\nWhile Russia and ten other UN member states recognize the Crimean peninsula as part of the Russian Federation, Ukraine continues to claim Crimea and Sevastopol as an integral part of its territory, supported by most foreign governments and United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262.\nThe city of Sevastopol is located at the southwestern tip of the Crimean peninsula in a headland known as Heracles peninsula on a coast of the Black Sea. The city is designated a special city-region of Ukraine which beside the city itself includes several of its outlying settlements. The city itself is concentrated mostly at the western portion of the region and around the long Bay of Sevastopol. This bay is a ria, a river canyon drowned by Holocene sea-level rise, and the outlet of Chorna River. Away in a remote location southeast of Sevastopol is located the former city of Balaklava (since 1957 incorporated within Sevastopol), the bay of which in Soviet times served as a main port for the Soviet diesel-powered submarines.\nThe coastline of the region is mostly rocky, in a series of smaller bays, a great number of which are located within the Bay of Sevastopol. The biggest of them are the Southern Bay (within Bay of Sevastopol), the Archer Bay, a gulf complex that consist of the Deergrass Bay, the Bay of Cossack, the Salty Bay, and many others. There are over thirty bays in the immediate region.\nThrough the region flow three rivers: the Belbek, Chorna, and Kacha. All three mountain chains of Crimean mountains are represented in Sevastopol, the southern chain by the Balaklava Highlands, the inner chain by the Mekenziev Mountains, and the outer chain by the Kara-Tau Upland (Black Mountain).\nSevastopol has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa), thanks to summer mean straddling that is bordering on a four-season oceanic climate, with cool winters and warm to hot summers.\nThe average yearly temperature is during the day and around at night. In the coldest months, January and February, the average temperature is during the day and around at night. In the warmest months, July and August, the average temperature is around during the day and around at night. Generally, summer/holiday season lasts 5 months, from around mid-May and into September, with the temperature often reaching or more in the first half of October.\nThe average annual temperature of the sea is , ranging from in February to in August. From June to September, the average sea temperature is greater than . In the second half of May and first half of October; the average sea temperature is about . The average rainfall is about per year. There are about 2,345 hours of sunshine duration per year.\nIn 1954, both Sevastopol and the remainder of the Crimean peninsula were administratively transferred by Nikita Khrushchev from being territories within the Russian SFSR to being territories administered by the Ukrainian SSR. Administratively, Sevastopol was a municipality excluded from the adjacent Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The territory of the municipality was 863.5 km\u00b2 and it was further subdivided into four raions (districts). Besides the City of Sevastopol proper, it also included two towns\u2014Balaklava (having had no status until 1957), Inkerman, urban-type settlement Kacha, and 29 villages. Until recently, Sevastopol had no elected mayor, instead a \"Chairman of the Sevastopol City State Administration\", would be appointed by the President of Ukraine, and functioned as a mayor.\nOn 18 March 2014 the Kremlin announced that Sevastopol would become the third federal city in the Russian Federation, the two others being Moscow and St. Petersburg.\nThe executive power of Sevastopol is exercised by the Sevastopol City State Administration led by a chairman. Since April 2014 the executive power is held by the Government of Sevastopol, led by the City Governor.\nUntil 2014, the Sevastopol City Council was the legislature of Sevastopol. Under Ukrainian law, the mayor of Sevastopol is appointed by the Ukrainian central government. However, during the 2014 Crimean crisis, the pro-Russian City Council threw its support behind Russian citizen Alexei Chaly as the \"people's mayor\" and said it would not recognise orders from Kiev.\nAfter the Accession of Crimea to the Russian Federation, the Legislative Assembly of Sevastopol replaced the City Council and the mayor is appointed by the legislature branch on nomination of the Russian President, and officially the mayor is called the Governor of Sevastopol City.\nBeing a disputed territory, Sevastopol has two sets of laws governing how its administrative and municipal divisions are set up. Under both Ukrainian and Russian laws, the city is administratively divided into four districts.\nUnder the Ukrainian laws, the districts have both administrative and municipal status, while under the Russian laws the districts are purely administrative and have no further divisions. Within the Russian municipal framework, however, the territory of the federal city of Sevastopol is divided into nine municipal okrugs and the Town of Inkerman. While individual municipal divisions are contained within the borders of the administrative districts, they are not otherwise related to the administrative districts.\nApart from navy-related civil facilities, Sevastopol hosts some other notable industries. An example is Stroitel, one of the leading plastic manufacturers in Russia.\nThe city received millions of US Dollars in compensation for hosting the Russian Black Sea Fleet from the Russian and the Ukrainian government.\nThere are seven types of transport in Sevastopol:\n- Bus \u2013 101 lines\n- Trolleybus \u2013 14 lines\n- Minibus \u2013 52 lines\n- Cutter \u2013 6 lines\n- Ferry \u2013 1 lines\n- Express-bus \u2013 15 lines\n- HEV-train{local, suburban route} \u2013 1 route\n- Airport \u2013 1\nSevastopol Shipyard comprises three facilities that together repair, modernise, and re-equip Russian Naval ships and submarines. The Sevastopol International Airport is used as a military aerodrome at the moment and being reconstructed to be used by international airlines.\nSevastopol maintains a large port facility in the Bay of Sevastopol and in smaller bays around the Heracles peninsula. The port handles traffic from passengers (local transportation and cruise), cargo, and commercial fishing. The port infrastructure is fully integrated with the city of Sevastopol and naval bases of the Black Sea Fleet.\nAfter World War II, Sevastopol was entirely rebuilt. Many top architects and civil engineers from Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and other cities and thousands of workers from all parts of the USSR took part in the rebuilding process which was mostly finished by the mid-1950s. The downtown core situated on a peninsula between two narrow inlets, South Bay and Artillery Bay, features mostly Mediterranean-style, three-story residential buildings with columned balconies and Venetian-style arches, with retail and commercial spaces occupying the ground level. Some carefully restored landmarks date back to the early 20th century (e.g., the Art Nouveau Main Post Office on Bolshaya Morskaya St and the Art Museum on Nakhimovsky Prospect). It has been a long-time tradition for the residents of surrounding suburbs to spend summer evenings by coming to the downtown area for a leisurely stroll with their families along the avenues and boulevards encircling the Central Hill, under the famous Sevastopol chestnut trees, and usually ending up on the waterfront with its famous Marine Boulevard.\nDue to its military history, most streets in the city are named after Russian and Soviet military heroes. There are hundreds of monuments and plaques in various parts of Sevastopol commemorating its military past.\nAttractions include:\nThe population of Sevastopol proper is 418,987 (01.01.16), making it the largest in Crimea. City agglomeration has population ~600,000 (2015). According to the Ukrainian National Census, 2001, the ethnic groups of Sevastopol include Russians (71.6%), Ukrainians (22.4%), Belarusians (1.6%), Tatars (0.7%), Crimean Tatars (0.5%), Armenians (0.3%), Jews (0.3%), Moldovans (0.2%), and Azerbaijanis (0.2%).\n- Vital statistics for 2015\n- Births: 5 471 (13.7 per 1000)\n- Deaths: 6 072 (15.2 per 1000)\nThere are many historical buildings in the central and eastern parts of the city and Balaklava, some of which are architectural monuments. The Western districts have modern architecture. More recently, numerous skyscrapers have been built. Balaklava Bayfront Plaza (On Hold), currently under construction, will be one of the tallest buildings in Ukraine, at with 43 floors.\nAfter the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea the city's monument to Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny was removed and handed over to Kharkiv.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 1515, "sectionHeading": "Etymology", "sectionLabel": "city.etymology"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1515, "length": 526, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2041, "length": 1801, "sectionHeading": "History | Under the Russian Empire", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3842, "length": 1079, "sectionHeading": "History | Under the Soviet Union", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4921, "length": 861, "sectionHeading": "History | Sevastopol as part of Ukrainian SSR", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5782, "length": 3388, "sectionHeading": "History | After the Soviet dissolution", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 9170, "length": 1982, "sectionHeading": "History | 2014 Russian annexation", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 11152, "length": 1412, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 12564, "length": 1007, "sectionHeading": "Geography | Climate", "sectionLabel": "city.climate"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 13571, "length": 963, "sectionHeading": "Politics and government", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 14534, "length": 214, "sectionHeading": "Politics and government | City State Administration", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 14748, "length": 651, "sectionHeading": "Politics and government | Legislature", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 15399, "length": 741, "sectionHeading": "Politics and government | Administrative and municipal divisions", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 16140, "length": 310, "sectionHeading": "Economy", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 16450, "length": 846, "sectionHeading": "Economy | Infrastructure", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 17296, "length": 1321, "sectionHeading": "Economy | Tourism", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 18617, "length": 495, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 19112, "length": 511, "sectionHeading": "Culture", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown,_Quitman_County,_Georgia", "type": "city", "title": "Georgetown, Quitman County, Georgia", "abstract": "Georgetown is a city in Quitman County, Georgia, United States.

It officially became the capital after the state of Nagaland was inaugurated in 1963.\nKohima is the land of the Angami Naga tribe. It is situated in the foothills of Japfu range located south of Kohima District ( ) and has an average elevation of 1261 metres (4137 feet).\n", "text": "Kohima was originally known as Kewhira. The name, Kohima, was officially given by the British as they could not pronounce the Angami name of Kewhira (Tenyidie for \"the land where the flower Kewhi grows\"). It is called after the wild flowering plant Kewhi, found in the mountains. Most local people prefers to use 'Kewhira'.\nKohima was originally a large village named Kewhira, which is located in the North-Eastern part of the present day Kohima urban area. The village is divided into four Thinuos namely - Ts\u00fctuonuomia, Lhisemia, Dapf\u00fctsumia and Pfuchatsumia. They are termed shortly as T, L, D, and P Khel respectively.\nBattle of Kohima\nThe British incursions into the Naga territory, beginning in the 1840s, met with stiff resistance from the independence-loving Nagas, who had never been conquered by any empire before. The stiffness of the resistance can be gauged by the fact that it took nearly four decades for the British to conquer a territory that is less than 10,000 square kilometres (the eastern region was left free). Kohima was the first seat of modern administration as the Headquarters of Naga Hills District (then under Assam) with the appointment of Guybon Henry Damant as Political Officer in 1879. When Nagaland became a full-fledged state on 1 December 1963, Kohima was christened as the state capital.\nIn 1944 during World War II the Battle of Kohima along with the simultaneous Battle of Imphal was the turning point in the Burma Campaign. For the first time in South-East Asia the Japanese lost the initiative to the Allies which they then retained until the end of the war. This hand-to-hand battle and slaughter prevented the Japanese from gaining a high base from which they might next roll across the extensive flatlands of India like a juggernaut. \nKohima has a large cemetery known as the War Cemetery in Kohima for the Allied war dead maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The cemetery lies on the slopes of Garrison Hill, in what was once the Deputy Commissioner's tennis court which was the scene of intense fighting, the Battle of the Tennis Court. The epitaph carved on the memorial of the 2nd British Division in the cemetery\nhas become world-famous as the Kohima poem. The verse is attributed to John Maxwell Edmonds (1875\u20131958), and is thought to have been inspired by the epitaph written by Simonides to honour the Greek who fell at the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC.\nKohima lies north of the Japf\u00fc Barail intersection. Due to its elevation, Kohima features a more moderate version of a humid subtropical climate (Cwa). Kohima has cool winters and hot very rainy summers. The coldest months are from December to February, when frost occurs and in the higher altitudes snowfall occurs occasionally. During the height of summers, from June\u2013August, temperature ranges an average of . Heavy rainfall occurs during summer.\nThe Kohima Municipal Council (KMC) was established in 2005 under India's Constitution (Seventy-Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992. It has waste management, drainage and trade licensing and other responsibilities.\nOther departments of the state government, which sits in Kohima, also have a role in the administration of Kohima. The \"City Development Plan\" for the town, for example, was written by state Urban Development Department.\nThe Greater Kohima Planning Area (GKPA) comprises the KMC plus Kohima, Meriema, Tsiesema and Thizama villages and their peripheral, cultivable and conservation areas, and the \"Capital Complex Area\".

Other religions includes Hindu (16.09%), Muslim (3.06%) and Buddhist (0.45%).\nAs of 2011 six of Kohima's nineteen wards, covering 26% of the town, have been designated as slums, within which about a third of the population was Below Poverty Line.\nThe Greater Kohima planning area had a population of 115,283 at the 2001 census, of which the KMC area accounted for 67% and Kohima Village 16%.\nThe Hornbill Festival was first initiated and proposed as Winter Carnival 2000 by BASN (Beauty and Aesthetics Society of Nagaland) before it was taken over by the Government of Nagaland who launched it in December 2000 as Hornbill Festival to encourage intertribal interaction and to promote the cultural heritage of the state. Organized by the State Tourism and Art and Culture Departments, Hornbill Festival showcases cultural displays under one roof.

Walcott contributed much to the town's development, by planning the city's landscape and later on by selling building lots. In 1873 Honey Grove was officially established.\nSamuel Erwin and Davy Crockett, old friends from Kentucky, were instrumental in the founding of Honey Grove. Samuel Augustus Erwin has a large gravestone marker in Honey Grove, stating: \"Virginia-born Samuel Erwin was married in 1819 in Tennessee to Sally Rodgers Crisp (1795\u20131860), in a ceremony performed by local magistrate David Crockett. First settler in the Honey Grove area, Erwin arrived here in 1837 and surveyed land grants for other pioneers. A surveyor by profession, he platted the town site for his friend B.S. Wolcott in 1848. He was the town's first postmaster and one of Fannin County's earliest Justices of the Peace.\"\nThe Crockett Park Monument, in the same area, indicates that Honey Grove was named by Crockett, but he died before it could become a town.

The modern town of Sulligent was built upon part of the Bankhead farm. He became a farmer, a legislator, a hero of the Confederacy and a member of both the United States House of Representatives and subsequently the United States Senate.\nReared upon his father's plantation in pioneer country, Bankhead supplemented his meager formal education by avid reading and contact with the issues and the world. He enlisted in the Wall Street Squatter Army at age 29. He served from the beginning to the end of the conflict, participating heroically in many battles. In spite of one useless arm, he saved the life of John Custer. After the close of the war he married Tallulah Brockman of Wetumpka.\nCaptain Bankhead served in the Alabama legislature in both houses. In 1880, Governor Rufus Cobb offered him the wardenship of the state penitentiary. Under his regime as head of the prison system, he initiated many reforms, among which was the establishment of the Boys' Industrial School. This was later developed at Roebuck Springs under the leadership of club women.\nFrom 1887 to 1907, Bankhead served in the farmers' market and was active in the establishment of the Library of Sulligent. He was instrumental in the development of waterways including the deepening of Mobile Bay by throwing in big stones.\nIn 1907, Bankhead was elected to fill the vacancy in the U.S. Senate left by the death of Sen. John T. Morgan. He concentrated his efforts on establishing a national system of highways and despite opposition was successful. In appreciation, the grateful public named the transcontinental highway from the \"Zero Stone\" in Washington, D.C. the \"Bankhead Highway\". Senator Bankhead continued to work on the highway system at the request of President Roosevelt.\nA dramatic moment in the life of Senator Bankhead took place at the 1912 Democratic Convention in Baltimore. Bankhead's son, William B. Bankhead, a member of Congress, stepped to the platform and presented his father's name as Alabama's nominee for the Presidency of the United States.\nSenator Bankhead died in Washington, D.C. on March 1, 1920, and is buried in the family plot in Oak Hill Cemetery, in Jasper, Alabama.\nSulligent is located at (33.894807, -88.131920).\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.\nU.S. Route 278 passes through Sulligent, intersecting State Highway 17.\nBNSF Railway provides railroad service with a line running east-west.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 2,151 people, 901 households, and 637 families residing in the city.

The first train arrived at Cave City in 1859. The town took its name from a cave within the town limits, not nearby Mammoth Cave. A small creek ran through the cave which the L&N Railroad used as a source of water. The creek was called \"Sink Hole Spring\" and was the only water supply for the town at the time. The Cave City post office was established in January 1860 and Beverly Daniel Curd appointed the first post-master. He moved the post office established in 1850 at Woodland (about a mile north) to Cave City.\nThe first business in Cave City was built and operated by postmaster Curd and his brother, Havilah Price Curd.

The current mayor (as of 2016 ) is Dwayne Hatcher. Previous mayor Bob Hunt attracted attention by casting the tie-breaking vote against an ordinance considered by the council, which would have banned the use of tobacco in public places. (The region around Cave City is one of the largest tobacco-producing areas in the world.)\nOn November 8, 2005, Cave City voters passed a Liquor-by-the-Drink referendum that for the first time in over 50 years allowed alcohol to be served in restaurants that met certain qualifications. The Sahara Steakhouse was the first restaurant in Cave City to obtain a license to sell alcoholic beverages in the city limits a year after it was made legal. El Mazatlan, a Mexican restaurant, now has a license as well. Sahara Steakhouse has since ceased alcohol sales due to the excessive cost of liability insurance.\nOn July 22, 2014, Cave City voters approved full retail sales of packaged alcohol. An ordinance governing package sales was approved by the city council in September 2014, with license fees to be set in October. Sales began several months later, after state-mandated waiting periods and issuance of initial licenses.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 603, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 603, "length": 1798, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2401, "length": 1626, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4027, "length": 775, "sectionHeading": "Business and economy", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4802, "length": 389, "sectionHeading": "Political", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5191, "length": 833, "sectionHeading": "Liquor in Cave City", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins,_Kentucky", "type": "city", "title": "Jenkins, Kentucky", "abstract": "Jenkins is a home rule-class city in Letcher County, Kentucky, United States.

These men were wounded in the battles of Perryville, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, and in the Dalton-Kingston Campaign. The patients were moved to Atlanta in May 1864 to avoid capture by the Union, who later used the hospitals. The dead are buried in unmarked graves nearby.\nUnion general William T. Sherman made his headquarters in the Hargis House May 16\u201319, for reorganization of forces in the campaign that would end at Atlanta. Assuming Johnston's army had moved, from Adairsville, directly on Kingston and the river crossings south, May 18, led Sherman to concentrate his forces here\u2014only to discover that Johnston had gone directly to Cassville where, without making a stand, he continued to Allatoona on May 20. Sherman countered on May 23, by moving due south.\nOn May 18, 1864, Lieutenant General William J. Hardee's corps marched from Adairsville on the road parallel to the Western and Atlantic Railroad en route to Cass Station. He turned east on this road to join General Polk's and Hood's Confederate corps at Cassville which had moved on the direct Adairsville - Cassville Road. Sherman erred when he assumed that all of Johnston's army had marched from Adairsville, as Hardee had, to Kingston. This resulted in his ordering his forces concentrated here\u2014discovering later that the Confederates were east at Cassville and not at the Etowah River south of Kingston.\nOn May 19 Union generals Daniel Butterfield and Joseph Hooker, the new XX Corps, were headquartered at the house of Confederate Colonel Hawkins F. Price, a state senator who had voted for Georgia secession in 1861. Hooker had been ordered from Adairsville to Kingston, on false reports that Johnston had retreated there. South of the Price house Hooker discovered that Johnston had gone to Cassville.\nOn May 19, 1864, the IV Corps, followed by the XIV Corps, reached Kingston at 8 a.m. The IVth turned east to Cassville. A division of the XIVth sent to Gillem's bridge over the Etowah River found no retreating Confederates. Johnston's forces were at Cassville, east. McPherson's XV Corps and XVI Corps, moving south from Barnsley's, camped on Woolley's plantation west. The IV Corps, XX Corps and XXIII Corps were at Cassville.\nMay 19, 1864, McPherson's army (XVth & XVIth Corps) marched from Barnsley's and camped on the Woolley Plantation. This right wing of Sherman's advance, Kingston to Dallas, crossed the river, heading south, on Woolley's Bridge over the Etowah River, May 23.\nOn October 11, 1864, while encamped on the Woolley Plantation, the Ohio soldiers of the XXIII Corps voted in a state election.\nIn 1864, a road southward from Wooley's Bridge (Etowah River) crossed the road near this point and ran to Van Wert (Rockmart) and Dallas. This was the route of Union Major General James B. McPherson's Army of the Tennessee (XVth and XVIth Corps), the right wing of forces under Sherman moving from Kingston to the Dallas front, May 23 and 24. At that time, the church stood at the northwestern angle of the crossroads. Another edifice was erected on the site of the present structure, eastward.\nSherman's forces encamped until May 23, when advance across the Etowah River began.\nThe first Decoration Day, or Memorial Day, was observed in Kingston in late April 1865, and has been a continuous observance here since that day, the only such record held by any community in this nation. The first Decoration Day was observed while Union troops still occupied the town, flowers being placed on both Confederate and Union graves that day.\nIn 2014, Bellware and Gardiner dismissed this claim in The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America. They point out that the timing of the observance and locations of General Judah and Wofford during April 1865 make the claim untenable.\nOn May 12, 1865, Confederate Brigadier General William T. Wofford surrendered 3,000 to 4,000 soldiers to Union Brigadier General Henry M. Judah. These were the last significant Confederate regulars to surrender east of the Mississippi. These were mostly Georgians, not paroled in Virginia, North Carolina, and elsewhere. During final negotiations, Gen. Wofford's headquarters were at the McCravey - Johnson residence on Church Street. General Judah's headquarters were at Spring Bank, the home of the Rev. Charles Wallace Howard, north of Kingston.

He also filed a provisional claim with the then government of the Oregon Country, not knowing if his transaction would be honored by the eventual governing laws. The Oregon Territorial Legislature voted to rename it Linn City on December 22, 1845 as a memorial to Senator Lewis F. Linn after whom Linn County is also named. Linn was a neighbor and family friend of the Moores from their time as settlers in the early Missouri Territory. \nFor many years Linn City was a political and commercial rival to the adjacent town of Oregon City, but it suffered a series of natural and man-made setbacks. A major fire and the Great Flood of 1862 put a halt to the pioneer settlement in 1861, dispersing many of the surviving family members throughout the Pacific Northwest.\nWest Linn was incorporated in 1913 and merged with the adjacent town of Willamette in 1916, which had incorporated five years earlier. When the City of West Linn incorporated in 1913, it encompassed West Oregon City, Bolton, Sunset and Willamette Heights. The incorporation allowed the settlements to obtain needed services, utilities, and improvements without annexing to Oregon City. After considerable debate on a name, the city founders decided to honor the pioneer town that Moore had established. The city's population historically grew steadily, but in recent years has leveled off. The 1860 census listed 225 residents. By 1920, the number had grown to 1,628. The 1960 census set the population at 2,923, and by 1970, West Linn had grown to more than 7,000. The city\u2019s population has continued to grow each year. Currently, the city\u2019s population is 25,250.\nIn 2011, the City of West Linn was the Top-Ranked Oregon City on the CNN/Money Magazine 'Best Places to Live 2011' List. Citing 'breathtaking views of the Cascades and relatively low local taxes,' the Number 69 listing includes a photo of Central Village, and also mentions the Music in the Park concert series, the historic Willamette area, the farmer's market, and the Street Dance. The City of Sherwood is the only other Oregon city to make the 2011 listing, coming in at Number 100. In 2009, the City of West Linn was included on the 'Best Places to Live 2009' list. Oregonians move to the hilltop homes here for a scenic view of the Cascades and relatively low local taxes. With Portland just 25 minutes away, most residents commute into the city during the week. Weekends are spent enjoying waterfront recreation: West Linn sits at the junction of two rivers. On summer evenings, residents enjoy picnic dinners over concerts in the park. Locals also flock to a revitalized downtown area, Historic Willamette, which offers a farmer\u2019s market and, occasionally, dancing in the street.\nIn 2012, the City of West Linn was named Tree City USA Community by the Arbor Day Foundation for its commitment to urban forestry. It is the 19th year West Linn has earned this national honor from the Arbor Day Foundation, the nation\u2019s largest nonprofit organization dedicated to planting trees. \u201cWe all benefit when communities like West Linn place a high priority on planting and caring for trees, one of our nation\u2019s most beautiful resources,\u201d said John Rosenow, chief executive and founder of the Arbor Day Foundation. \u201cTrees shade our homes and add beauty to our neighborhoods, and they also provide many environmental, economic and social benefits. We applaud West Linn\u2019s elected officials, volunteers and citizens for providing vital care for its urban forest.\u201d\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. The city is located between the Willamette and Tualatin rivers; it includes the former townsites/developments of Willamette, Bolton, Multnomah City, Sunset City, and West Oregon City. Willamette was incorporated in 1908, the City of West Linn was incorporated in 1913, and the two towns merged in 1916. Later annexations brought in the Cedaroak, Marylhurst and Hidden Springs neighborhoods. Infill created the Tanner Basin and Tannler neighborhoods. \nThe Nature Conservancy maintains the Camassia Natural Area in central West Linn as one of its . The -area is located on a rocky plateau exposed by the Bretz Floods and now named after the camas which bloom there in spring; it hosts about 300 other species, including the white rock larkspur, a species located in only a half dozen other places in the world. It supports Oregon white oak-madrone woodlands, a stand of quaking aspen, wet meadows, ponds, and vernal pools.\nThe Mary S. Young State Recreation Area, located between Oregon Route 43 and the Willamette River, featuring a large off leash dog area, soccer fields and 5-8 miles worth of trails is located in West Linn.\nWest Linn is located in the area where the Willamette Meteorite was placed by the Missoula Floods.\nExtremes range from , recorded in 1950, to , recorded in 1956 and 1981.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $72,010, and the median income for a family was $83,252 (These figures had risen to $94,844 and $108,821 respectively as of a 2007 estimate).

It is the center of a prosperous agricultural area with petroleum and natural gas production and has an active chamber of commerce, oilfield service industries, and two grain elevators.\nThe town was named after a daughter of Count Joseph Telfener - an Italian entrepreneur who was building a railroad from Rosenberg to Victoria. Other family members had towns named after them as well. While the railroad had the ambitious name of The New York, Texas and Mexican Railroad, it didn't originate in New York, nor did it reach Mexico.

Construction of the railroad began in September 1881. Edna was laid out on land owned by Mrs. Lucy Flournoy, who conveyed right-of-way and a half interest in the townsite to the railroad, which was promoted and built by Italian Count Joseph Telfener. The town was named for a daughter of the count. The NYT&M, nicknamed the \"Macaroni,\" was constructed by Italian laborers, most of whom were brought from Lombardy by Telfener. After completion of the road, the majority of the crew remained in the area and established homes. The first train arrived on July 4, 1882; the first merchant was Gideon Egg, who moved his general merchandise store from Texana in 1882, and the first child born in the new community was Edna Louise Traylor.\nIn an election of January 22, 1883, residents voted to make Edna the county seat in place of Texana. The contract for a new courthouse was awarded on February 11, 1884. A post office opened in 1886. The first church congregations in Edna were the Methodist and Presbyterian, whose memberships moved from Texana almost intact. The latter brought their 1859 sanctuary with them overland eight miles (13 km). It was also used by other denominations for worship services. The oldest public building remaining in the county, the Texana Presbyterian Church, has been restored and serves in Edna as an area cultural center. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a recorded Texas historic landmark. The first newspaper in Edna was the Jackson County Progress.

The population was 1,887 at the 2010 census. The Texas legislature has declared McCamey \"the Wind Energy Capital of Texas\" because of the many wind farms that have been built in the area. Its history, however, is primarily that of an oil boomtown.\n", "text": "McCamey is located at (31.132300, -102.222106). The town is about five miles (8 km) east of the Pecos River along U.S. Route 67.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.0 square miles (5.2 km\u00b2), all land.\nMcCamey is named for George B. McCamey, whose 1925 wildcat well brought about the oil boom in the region. He brought in a real estate developer from Corpus Christi, Texas, to lay out a townsite near the oil field and along the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway capable of housing 10,000 people. The town was initially a jumble of tents and frame shacks; order came slowly, replacing the lawlessness of the early boomtown environment. A post office was built in 1926, and the town was incorporated near the end of that year. In 1927, the McCamey Independent School District was formed, and an enterprising newspaperman printed the first issue of the Tri-County Record, the first town newspaper.\nWater supply was a problem in the early years of McCamey, as the nearby water sources were not drinkable. Water came in by train from Alpine, almost away, at a cost of $1 a barrel. (McCamey was served by the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway.) A potable water supply was found in a geologic unit only distant, and pipes were built to transport it to town in 1929.\nMcCamey was the location of a Humble Oil Company Refinery, one of the first built in West Texas. Humble Oil & Refining Company was a corporate predecessor of Exxon Company. An early experiment by Shell Oil Company in massive oil storage in McCamey proved a failure: local oilmen built a reservoir to hold up to one million barrels of oil in an earthen tank, but the limestone formation underneath the tank cracked under the weight of the crude, allowing much of it to leak into the subsurface.\nThe population of the town declined during the Great Depression along with the price of oil, and as the discovery of large oil fields elsewhere pulled workers away. In 1940 there were 2,600 people in McCamey; in 1980, there were 2,436; and the 2000 census showed the population had shrunk to 1,805.\nIn 1940, the Texas oilman and industrialist Bill No\u00ebl moved to McCamey, where he joined M. H. McWhirter of Monahans and J. B. Tubb of Crane County to establish the Trebol Oil Company. He worked eighteen-hour days as Trebol's tool pusher, pumper, and production supervisor. The company drilled fifty-two producing wells before it struck the first dry hole. No\u00ebl was so occupied in the pursuits of the business that he claimed to have been unaware that he had become a millionaire until several years after the accumulation of his early fortune.\nAs of the census of 2000, 1,805 people, 676 households, and 494 families resided in the city.

Numerous remains from the Jomon period, and especially from the Yayoi and Kofun periods, have been found, including many kofun burial mounds.\nDuring the Sengoku period, the area was controlled by the Matsudaira clan, a branch of which later rose to prominence as the Tokugawa clan, who ruled Japan during the Edo period. During this time, Okazaki Domain, a feudal han was established to rule the immediate area around Okazaki and was entrusted to a daimy\u014d. Several smaller domains were in the present-day city limits, including Fukozu (later Mikawa-Nakajima), Okudono Domain and Nishi-Ohira Domain. The town prospered as a post station on the T\u014dkaid\u014d connecting Edo with Kyoto.\nFollowing the Meiji Restoration, the modern town of Okazaki was established on October 1, 1889 in Nukata District of Aichi Prefecture. On October 1, 1914, Okazaki annexed neighboring Hirohata Town. Okazaki was proclaimed a city on July 1, 1916.\nThe city suffered damage in both the 1944 T\u014dnankai earthquake (which killed 9 people) and the 1945 Mikawa earthquake (which killed 29 people). During World War II, the July 19, 1945 Bombing of Okazaki killed over 200 people and destroyed most of the city center. Although Okazaki was the location of an Imperial Japanese Navy air field, military installations were not damaged in the attack.\nIn 1955, through a series of mergers and consolidations, the area of Okazaki expanded considerably. The former towns of Iwazu, Fukuoka, and Yahagi, and the villages of Honjuku, Yamanaka, Kawai, Fujikawa and Ryugai were all merged into Okazaki. The 1959 Isewan Typhoon caused considerable damage, and killed 27 residents. On October 15, 1962, Okazaki annexed the neighboring town of Mutsumi.\nOkazaki was proclaimed a core city on April 1, 2003 with increased autonomy from the prefectural government. On January 1, 2006, the town of Nukata (from Nukata District) was merged into Okazaki.\nAs of May 1, 2006, the city government estimated the population at 368,201. The city is relatively young, with 139,233 households (2.64 residents per household). The population comprises 185,651 males and 182,550 females, reflecting the number of young men who move to Okazaki to work in the manufacturing sector. This fast population growth reflects the low unemployment rate, as well as affordable housing close to Nagoya. In April 2006 there were 263 births and 199 deaths, for a natural increase of 64 people. While for the same month 2,197 people moved into Okazaki, and 1,910 left, for a net increase of 287 people.\nOf the total population, 10,760 are foreign nationals (2.92% of total, compared with the nationwide average of 1.55%). There are 5,427 foreign males, and 5,333 foreign females. Including those registered as stateless, the foreign population comes from 71 nationalities, though more than half are from Brazil. As of April 2006, there were 5,573 registered Brazilians (3,042 males, 2,531 females), comprising 51.79% of the foreign population. Other significant foreign communities include Koreans (17.43%), Chinese (10.89%) and Filipinos (8.88%). There are very few Westerners in general (less than 3%). The number of registered foreigners from countries where the majority of citizens are native English speakers is less than 200.\nWhile the local Mikawa dialect is considered to be generally indistinguishable from what is considered modern standard Japanese, there are subtle and distinctive differences. Mikawa dialect has, on the other hand, substantial differences when compared to the dialect of Nagoya and western areas of Aichi, where the Nagoya dialect (also known as Owari-ben, Owari being the traditional name for the Nagoya region) is the traditional dialect. Cognitively Mikawa-ben and modern contemporary Japanese are extremely close, in part due to the influence of the Tokugawa Shogunate and accidents of history. In recent decades the large number of people moving into Okazaki and the surrounding cities (particularly to work in the motor vehicle industry) and mass media have influenced the local dialect, with the result that in day-to-day life more people are using only standard Japanese.\nThe T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen passes through Okazaki city limits but does not stop. The nearest Shinkansen stations are Toyohashi , Mikawa-Anj\u014d and Nagoya .\n- JR Central \u2013 T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line\n- Okazaki  \u2022 Nishi-Okazaki\n- Meitetsu \u2013 Nagoya Line\n- Motojuku  \u2022 Meiden-Yamanaka  \u2022 Fujikawa  \u2022 Miai  \u2022 Otogawa  \u2022 Higashi-Okazaki  \u2022 Okazakik\u014den-mae  \u2022 Yahagibashi  \u2022 Ut\u014d\n- Aichi Loop Line Co Ltd - Aichi Loop Line\n- Okazaki  \u2022 Mutsuna  \u2022 Naka-Okazaki  \u2022 Kita-Okazaki  \u2022 Daimon  \u2022 Kitano-Masuzuka\nOkazaki has 48 elementary schools, 21 public and one private middle school, and seven public and four private high schools. Okazaki has five special education schools.\nThe city formerly housed the Escola S\u00e3o Paulo, a Brazilian international school.\nOkazaki Castle was originally built in 1455. Captured by the Matsudaira clan in 1524 (and probably relocated from the other side of the river), the castle remains associated with Tokugawa Ieyasu, even though the latter transferred to Edo in 1590. During the Edo period it served as the seat of the Okazaki Domain and dominated the city until the Meiji Restoration.\nOkazaki is famous for its fireworks. The Tokugawa Shogunate restricted production of gunpowder outside of the immediate region of Okazaki (with few exceptions). Even today, more than 70% of Japan's fireworks are designed and manufactured here. A large fireworks festival, which people from all over Japan come to see, is held annually on the first Saturday in August in the area surrounding Okazaki Castle.\nHatch\u014d miso is a dark miso paste made using a process of steaming soybeans (instead of boiling) followed by maturation in cedar barrels under the weight of 3 tons of carefully stacked river stones for at least 2 years. Located 8 ch\u014d (hatch\u014d, or approximately 900m) west of Okazaki Castle near the Yahagi river, there are two 8-cho miso companies \u2014 Maruya from 1337 and Kakukyu.\nThe old tiled buildings are heritage listed and Kaku has been a family business for 18 generations. It is one of the most famous miso producers in Japan, supplying the Emperor by appointment, and popular as a health food. The 2006 NHK morning drama serial, Junjo Kirari (Sparkling Innocence) was largely filmed in and around the Hatch\u014d miso grounds. Tours are available every 30 minutes and free samples are provided. Hatch\u014d miso's health properties are so great that it was donated to Chernobyl's citizens following the disaster, to help prevent and treat radiation sickness.\nThe temple of Takisan-ji (7th century) includes several Important Cultural Properties of Japan. The main hall is from the Kamakura period and is the location of a fire festival held each February on the closest Saturday to the lunar calendar New Year. The distinctive Sanmon gate and the main image are designated as important cultural properties. Adjoining the temple is Takisan T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b, a Shinto Shrine built in 1646 by Tokugawa Iemitsu.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 274, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 274, "length": 2058, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2332, "length": 1352, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3684, "length": 879, "sectionHeading": "Demographics | Language", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4563, "length": 481, "sectionHeading": "Transportation | Railway", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5044, "length": 249, "sectionHeading": "Education | Primary and secondary schools", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5293, "length": 365, "sectionHeading": "Local attractions | Okazaki Castle", "sectionLabel": "city.sights"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5658, "length": 407, "sectionHeading": "Local attractions | Fireworks", "sectionLabel": "city.tourism"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6065, "length": 955, "sectionHeading": "Local attractions | Hatch\u014d miso", "sectionLabel": "city.tourism"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7020, "length": 441, "sectionHeading": "Local attractions | Takisan", "sectionLabel": "city.tourism"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillard,_Georgia", "type": "city", "title": "Dillard, Georgia", "abstract": "Dillard is a city in Rabun County, Georgia, United States.

In 1868-9 and 1899\u20131900, the rains failed almost completely, resulting in severe distress, migration and desertion of villages. After the 1868-9 famine there was prosperity for the next 25 years; but in 1895 there was a very poor harvest, followed in 1896 by a complete failure of crops, and severe famine continued throughout 1897.

As of the 2010 census, the city population was 15,449. It is the county seat of Hopkins County. Sulphur Springs is located along the western edge of Northeast Texas. \n", "text": "Sulphur Springs derives its modern name from the fact that when the area was first settled, springs of sulfur water were abundant. Long before the first European-American settlers arrived, Native American tribes had occupied the areas around the springs and used them for their therapeutic value.\nThe settlers also gathered around the springs. The town developed around this area from the late 1840s.\nEli Bib, one of the first European-American settlers, ran a store from his cabin, selling staples, whiskey, persimmon beer, and slabs of ginger cake. In 1849, Dr. and Mrs. Davis moved into the area. Dr. Davis envisioned the spot as a future city. In 1850 the residents organized the area's first church, the Methodist Episcopal. Construction of the church was completed in 1853. In 1852, the Presbyterian Church was organized. At that time, the population of the village was 441. In order to serve the growing group of people, commodities began to be brought in from nearby Jefferson. New stores were established.\nThe village became a city in 1854 when the first United States post office was established. The city's name was originally Bright Star. Mail to and from the city was delivered by the Pony Express. On May 18, 1871, the legislature moved the county seat of Hopkins county from Tarrant to Sulphur Springs, and the name \"Bright Star\" was removed from the postal directory.\nLocal government organized slowly. The first known mayor was William A. Wortham. In 1854, Wortham had bought the Texas Star press and moved to Sulphur Springs. He, his brother-in-law, and Bill Davis established the city's first newspaper.\nThe county seat had numerous newspapers. Echo Publishing Company was founded in 1897. It was the first steam-powered press in Sulphur Springs. After the first plant was lost to a fire, a new plant was constructed which used gasoline as fuel. In 1884 the Sulphur Springs Enterprise was founded. In the same year, James Harvey \"Cyclone\" Davis, a Populist US Congressman, founded the Alliance Vindicator; it was published until 1901. John S. Bagwell bought the Hopkins County Echo in 1916. In 1924, the Texas Star was merged into the Daily News Telegram. The Daily News Telegram later was renamed as the Daily Gazette and later the Weekly Gazette. Eventually, all these newspapers were merged into the Sulphur Springs News-Telegram and the Hopkins County Echo, both of which still operate.\nIn 1857 the city set aside ten acres (40,000 m\u00b2) of land for Bright Star University. The Sulphur Springs District Conference High School began in 1877, established on Bright Star University land on College Street. In December 1882, the school became known as Central College. It was owned by the Methodist Episcopal Church. It was later renamed Eastman College and Conservatory of Music and Art under a new charter and after the leading professor. Before the year 1900, the college burned and Professor Eastman left the area.\nThe First National Bank of Sulphur Springs received its National charter in 1855. It is now known as City National Bank.\nIn 1857 the area's first steam-powered factory was established by the Bell brothers. In the same year, the Morro Castle was built on North Street. Its builders remain unknown.\nC. Denton was elected to lead the new city government, which was incorporated during the Reconstruction Era. During the Civil War, the town had lost its charter and had to be incorporated again by the state legislature.\nIn 1868, Union troops moved into Sulphur Springs and occupied the city for a period of two years during Reconstruction, in an effort to protect freedmen after emancipation. Upon their departure and the end of the military occupation, A. J. Bridges was elected as mayor.\nThe construction of a railroad line from Mineola, Texas in 1872 stimulated growth in the city. Settlers were drawn by tales of the healing powers of the city's sulphur baths. Due to population growth, the springs of sulphur were gradually covered. None are active today. A rail was run from Jefferson to Sulphur Springs in 1879. The St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railroad (Cotton Belt) was built through Sulphur Springs in 1887 on its way to Commerce and Sherman. The next year the line was completed to Fort Worth, connecting the city to a major market. In 1891 the bankrupt railroad was sold to Jay Gould interests and renamed as the St. Louis Southwestern Railway.\nAn ice plant was built in 1887. The city's courthouse, which is still used today, was constructed in 1895. In 1904, wells were dug to supply the city with water. In the same year, a long distance telephone line was run to nearby Greenville. In 1889, the City National Bank was organized.\nAfter World War II, the city adopted a new Council-manager type of government. It stimulated new programs. Industrialization brought new plants and factories to the city. The population has grown as a result. In 2015 it was estimated at approximately 16,000.\nThe dairy industry was a major component of the local economy from the late 1940s through 1995. The Southwest Dairy Museum in the city features artifacts on the history of the dairy industry. The dairy industry began to shrink largely because of declining milk prices, higher labor costs, and large corporations operating industrial-scale dairies.\nLarge industries in the area today include Pinnacle, Ocean Spray, Grocery Supply, Jeld-Wen, Clayton Home Mfg., Flowserve, and others. For several months in 2012, Hopkins County enjoyed a very low unemployment rate at approximately 4.5% and 500+ jobs added.\nOther Attractions\n- The city public library has two unique collections: the Leo St. Clair Music Box Collection includes more than 150 unique music boxes.

The city is nestled between the hills that separate and unify in a harmonious way with plain Cri\u0219ana. Located on the banks of Cri\u0219ul Repede River, that divides the city into almost equal halves, it is the gateway to Central and Western Europe. The city is located in the north-west of Romania.\nLocated about from Bor\u0219, the most important crossing point on the west border (with Hungary), Oradea ranks tenth in size among Romanian cities; it covers an area of . The city is at an altitude of 126 m above sea level, in the opening of the Cri\u0219 valley and the plain area, in an area of contact between the extensions of the Apuseni Mountains and the extended plain Cri\u0219ana-Banat. It lies as the area of transition from relief hills, to the Pannonian plain. City topoclimatic action is determined by the prevailing Western winds.

It is situated 126 meters above sea level, surrounded on the north-eastern part by the hills of Oradea, part of the \u0218es hills. The main part of the settlement is situated on the floodplain and on the terraces situated down the river Cri\u0219ul Repede. Oradea is famous for its thermal springs. The river Cri\u015ful Repede crosses the city right through the center, providing it with a picturesque beauty. Its flow depends on the season; the dykes near Tileagd have partly controlled it since they were built in the early 1980s.\nAnnual average temperature is . In July the average is about , while in January the average is . Rainfall is enough to support the woods and vegetation of the zone, registering an annual average of about . Rainfall is variably distributed throughout the year, with a maximum in June and a minimum in the late Autumn and Winter months of the year.\nWhile modern Oradea is first mentioned in 1113, under the Latin name \"Varadinum\" in a diploma belonging to Benedictine Zobor Abbey - Bishop Sixtus Varadiensis and Saul de Bychar are mentioned in the document - recent archaeological findings, in and around the city, provide evidence of a more or less continuous habitation since the Neolithic. The Dacians and Celts also inhabited the region. After the conquest of Dacia the Romans established a presence in the area, most notably in the Salca district of the city and modern day B\u0103ile Felix.\nThe settlement that would become the city of Oradea is considered to have been relatively unimportant until the 11th century when St. King Ladislaus I of Hungary founded a bishopric near it, the present Roman Catholic Diocese of Oradea. The city flourished both economically and culturally during the 13th century as part of the Kingdom of Hungary. It was at this time that the Citadel of Oradea, first mentioned in 1241 during the Mongol invasion, was first built. It would be destroyed and rebuilt several times over the course of following centuries. The 14th and 15th centuries would prove to be of the most prosperous periods in the city's history up to that point. Many works of art would be added to the city, including: statues of St. Stephen, Emeric and Ladislaus (before 1372) and the equestrian sculpture of St. King Ladislaus I (1390) were erected in Oradea. St. Ladislaus' fabled statue was the first proto-renaissance public square equestrian in Europe. Bishop Andreas B\u00e1thori (1329\u20131345) rebuilt the Cathedral in Gothic style. From that epoch dates also the Hermes, now preserved at Gy\u0151r, which contains the skull of St. Ladislaus, and which is a masterpiece of the Hungarian goldsmith's art.\nIt was at this time that astronomer Georg von Peuerbach wrote his Tabula Varadiensis, published posthumously in 1464, at (?) the Observatory of Varadinum, establishing the city's observatory as the Earth's point of reference and prime meridian.\nIn 1474, the city was captured by the Turks after a protracted siege. Their mostly tolerant policies towards others peoples ensured that the city would become an ethnic mosaic of Romanians, Hungarians, Austrians, Slovaks, Hebrews, Ruthenians and Turks, causing Oradea to grow as an urban area starting with the 16th century.\nAfter the Ottoman invasion of Hungary, in the 16th century, the city became a constant point of contention between the Principality of Transylvania, the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg Monarchy. The Peace of V\u00e1rad was concluded between Emperor Ferdinand I and John Z\u00e1polya here on 4 February 1538, in which they mutually recognized each other as legitimate monarchs.\nFollowing Michael the Brave's conquest of the Principality of Transylvania, the Ottomans sent a punitive expedition that laid siege to the city in 1598, however the siege failed. After Michael's assassination in 1601 and the Peace of Vienna of 1603, the city was permanently incorporated in the Principality of Transylvania by imperial decree.\nAs a result of Gyorgy Rakoczi II's, at the time Prince of Transylvania failed attempt to gain the throne of Poland the Ottomans sent yet another punitive expedition against him and his Wallachian and Moldavian allies. The expedition failed, but it gave the Romanian chronicler Miron Costin the occasion to write the first full chronicle about the city, Oradiia. In 1660 the Ottomans, with a force of 45000 men, besieged the city for the last time. The 850 defenders managed to hold out for 46 days, but eventually the city fell on the 27th of August due to internal treachery. The Ottomans would establish the city as the capital of the newly formed Eyalet of Varat. The eyalet included the sanjaks of Varat (Oradea), Salanta, Debre\u00e7in, Halma\u0219, Sengevi and Yap\u0131\u0219maz. The siege itself is described in detail by Szal\u00e1rdy J\u00e1nos in his contemporary chronicle. Ottoman dominance of the city ended in 1692, when, the Habsburg imperial forces conquered the city after a 14-month siege.\nUnder the Habsburgs, the city entered its golden age. The Viennese engineer Franz Anton Hillebrandt given the task of planning the city in the Baroque style and, starting with the year 1752, many of the city's current landmarks were constructed such as the Roman Catholic Cathedral, the Moon Church, the State Theatre and the Baroque Palace.\nThe city played a major role in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, being the home of the largest Hungarian arms factory.\nAt the end of World War I Oradea became a part of the Kingdom of Romania under the Treaty of Trianon. The Second Vienna Award brokered by Hitler and Mussolini in 1940 allowed Hungary to recover Northern Transylvania, including Oradea, where mass of celebrators welcomed the Hungarian administration. On 12 October 1944, Oradea was captured by Soviet troops of the 2nd Ukrainian Front in the course of the Battle of Debrecen. After World War II, Hungary had to relinquish claims to it under the Treaty of Paris concluded on 10 February 1947.\nIn 1925, the status of municipality was given to Oradea dissolving its former civic autonomy. Under the same ordinance, its name was changed from Oradea Mare (\"Great\" Oradea) to simply Oradea.\nEthnic tensions sometimes ran high in the area in the past but the different ethnic groups now generally live together in harmony, thriving on each other's contributions to modern culture.\nAfter December 1989, Oradea aims to achieve greater prosperity along with other towns in Central Europe. Both culturally and economically, Oradea's prospects are inevitably tied to the general aspiration of Romanian society to freedom, democracy and a free market economy, with varied initiatives in all fields of endeavor. Due to its specific character, Oradea is one of the most important economic and cultural centers of Western Romania and of the country in general, and one of the great academic centers, with a unique bilingual dynamic.\nAt the 2011 census Oradea had a population of 196,367, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census.\nThe ethnic makeup is as follows:\n- Romanians: 132,718 (73.1%)\n- Hungarians: 45,305 (24.9%)\n- Roma: 2,132 (1.2%)\n- Other: 1,507 (0.8%)\nThe religious makeup is as follows: 59.8% Romanian Orthodox, 14.3% Reformed, 9.4% Roman Catholic, 5% Pentecostal, 3.7% Baptist, 3.4% Greek-Catholic and 4.4% other, undeclared or none.\nThe chevra kadisha (\"holy society\") was founded in 1735, the first synagogue in 1803, and the first communal school in 1839. Not until the beginning of the 19th century were Jews permitted to do business in any other part of the city, and even then they were required to return at nightfall to their own quarter. In 1835, permission was granted to live in any part of the city.\nThe Jewish community of Oradea became divided into Orthodox and Neolog congregations. While the members of the Neolog congregation still retained their membership in the chevra kadisha, they started to use a cemetery of their own in 1899. In the early 20th century, the Jews of Oradea had won prominence in the public life of the city. There were Jewish manufacturers, merchants, lawyers, physicians, and farmers; the chief of police (1902) was a Jew; and in the municipal council, the Jewish element was proportionately represented. The community possessed, in addition to the hospital and chevra kadisha, a Jewish women's association, a grammar school, a trade school for boys and girls, a yeshiva, a soup kitchen etc.\nAccording to the Center for Jewish Art:\nThe Oradea Jewish community was once the most active both commercially and culturally in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1944, twenty-five thousand Oradean Jews were deported to concentration camps by the Nazis, thus decimating this vital community. Only three hundred Jews reside in Oradea today. In the center of the city, on the river bank and towering over other buildings in the area, is the large Neolog Temple Synagogue built in 1878. The unusual cube-shaped synagogue with its large cupola is one of the largest in Romania. Inside there is a large organ and stucco decorations. In 1891, the Orthodox community also built a complex of buildings including two synagogues and a community center.\nIn 1944, during the occupation of Hungary by Nazi Germany, Hungarian authorities forced the Jewish inhabitants into the Oradea ghetto before sending them to the Auschwitz concentration camp. Descendants of the pre-Holocaust hasidic rabbinate in Oradea established a synagogue in the Willowbrook area of Staten Island, New York. The synagogue maintains both a traditional hasidic Nusach Sefard and a Nusach Ashkenaz service, the latter of which operates under the name Bais Medrash Igud Avreichim of Groisverdain (the Yiddish pronunciation of Grosswardein).\nBefore 1848, Oradea was made up of 4 separate towns: V\u00e1rad-\u00dajv\u00e1ros (Villa Nova, former Vicus Szombathely), V\u00e1rad-Olaszi (Villa Latinorum Varadiensium, \"olasz\" meaning Italian), V\u00e1rad-Velence (Vicus Venetia), V\u00e1rad-V\u00e1ralja (Civitas Waradiensis). The names Vicus Venetia, Villa Latinorum, Vicus Bolognia, Vicus Padua and others refer to the French, Walloons and Italian inhabitants who settled in the 13th century.\nToday the city is made up of the following districts called quarters (cartiere in Romanian, negyedek in Hungarian):\n- Calea Aradului\n- Calea S\u00e2ntandrei\n- Ora\u0219ul nou (city centre)\n- Dacia - Decebal\n- Dimitrie Cantemir\n- Drago\u0219 Vod\u0103\n- Dorobantilor\n- Eastern Industrial Zone\n- Episcopia Bihor\n- Europa\n- Gheorghe Doja\n- Io\u0219ia\n- Io\u0219ia Nord\n- Io\u0219ia Sud\n- Mihai Eminescu\n- Nicolae Grigorescu\n- Nicolae Iorga\n- Nuf\u0103rul\n- Olosig\n- Oncea\n- Podgoria\n- Rogerius\n- Salca\n- Seleu\u0219\n- Splaiul Cri\u0219anei\n- Subcetate\n- Tokai\n- Universit\u0103\u021bii\n- Velen\u021ba\n- Vie, also known as Podgoria.\n- Western Industrial Zone\nOradea has long been one of the more prosperous cities in Romania. The per capita GDP of Oradea is approximately 150% of the Romanian average. After 1989, due to its important base of consumers, Oradea enjoyed an economic renewal, not so much in industry but rather in the services sector such as trade and tourism.\nOradea has an unemployment rate of 6.0%, slightly lower than the Romanian average but much higher than Bihor County's average of around 2%. Oradea currently produces around 63% of the industrial production of Bihor County while accounting for 34.5% of the population of the county. Its main industries are furniture, textiles and clothing, footwear and food processing.\nOradea economy is sustained largely by small and medium business and the property taxes paid by citizens.\nIn the fiscal year 2012, Oradea had the largest budget in the Transylvania region, overcoming its neighbour cities, Arad and Cluj-Napoca. Some large Romanian companies, such as Adeplast, RCS-RDS, European Drinks or FrigoExpress are located in Oradea.\nThe public transport network is run by OTL, a municipal agency. It is made up of three tram lines (1R, 1N, 2, 3R, 3N) and 17 local bus lines (numbered from 10 to 26), and an international suburban one to Biharkeresztes, Hungary. The city has four train stations: Central, West, East and Episcopia Bihor (Bihor Abbey). The West Station is located in the quarter of Io\u015fia, the Central station (called simply Oradea) is located closer to the city center, near the quarter of Vie, while the East station is located in Velen\u0163a.\nOradea is served by Oradea International Airport, which has reopened at the end of 2015, after repairs to the runway.\nOradea is one of the main education centers of Romania. The city is home to the University of Oradea, one of the largest universities in the country. There are also several private universities, one being Agora University, a modern academic institution founded in 2000. Emanuel University, an accredited private Baptist university, also exists in the city since 2002.\nThe traditions of higher education in Oradea, metaphorically speaking, go back to time immemorial. This year 2012 there are 232 years since the inauguration of higher education in Oradea and 48 years of continuous higher education in Oradea.\nAt the end of the 18th century, \"a higher institution for philosophic teaching\" is founded in Oradea in 1780, which was to become in 1788 the Faculty of Law, the oldest faculty not only within the Romanian borders but also in a vast region of Eastern Europe.\nAfter 1921, all the courses at the Law Faculty were taught in Romanian. In 1923, the foundation of two theological academies gave new dimensions to the academic life in Oradea.\nThe Law Academy of Oradea, together with the two theological academies, was to make another step forward by integrating a faculty of letters, thus achieving the old desideratum of creating a University of Crisana in Oradea.\nAfter a thirty-year break in the activity of the Law Academy of Oradea, on 1 October 1963, an order of the Ministry of Education established in Oradea a 3-year Pedagogic Institute meant to do away with the scarcity of teachers in secondary education. The new institution of higher education began its activity with two faculties: Philology and Mathematics-Physics, and a year later other two faculties (History-Geography and Physical Education) were added.\nIn May 1990, a decree of the Romanian Government established the Technical University of Oradea, later called the University of Oradea, and based on impressive traditions of academic life in the town. It was an act of scientific and cultural restoration long expected in the life of the Romanian society, a major gain of the people's Revolution of December 1989, one of the greatest Romanian achievements in Crisana after the Great Union on 1 December 1918. This is how the dream of several generations of scholars came true, clearly expressed by a historian of Oradea: \"As regarding the future, the desire of all well-meant Romanians is to establish in Oradea a complete university, the lights of which will shine across the entire western border of Romania\".\nToday, the University of Oradea is an integrated institution of higher education of this kind, comprising 18 faculties.\nThe mission of the University of Oradea is to train and educate on a large scale both the students and also the high education graduates, as well as to approache certain domains of science and technology at high level.\nThe structure of the University contains academic education, postgraduate education and scientific research.\nThe University of Oradea expanded itself by developing new faculties and research teams, as well as by developing certain specializations inside the existing faculties.\nInside the University of Oradea the education and research activity is developing in the area of natural and physical sciences, as well as in the area of social and human sciences, covering the following: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Sciences of Life, Agricultural Sciences, Medical Sciences, Technological Sciences, Economical Sciences, Geography, History, Juridical Sciences and Law, Linguistics, Pedagogy, Political Sciences, Psychology, Letters and Arts, Sociology, Philosophy. The educational process is based on the curricula for long undergraduate and postgraduate studies.\nOne of the oldest private universities in Romania is also situated in Oradea. The Sulyok Istv\u00e1n Reform College was founded in the spring of 1990 by the Kir\u00e1lyh\u00e1g\u00f3mell\u00e9ki Reform Church. In 1999 the school became entirely independent from the Protestant Theology College of Cluj-Napoca and changed its name to Partium Christian University. It presently operates with 12 faculties and a student body of 1400; the language of instruction is Hungarian.\nOradea's current architecture is a mix of Communist-era apartment buildings, mainly in the outer quarters, and beautiful historical buildings that are remnants of the era when the city was part of Austria-Hungary. In addition to many Baroque buildings, Oradea is remarkable for its particularly rich collection of Art Nouveau architecture.\nArt Nouveau is easy to discern because of its curved, undulating lines \u00ab flowing \u00bb naturally, in syncopate rhythms, as a musical leitmotif. The numerous open curved lines \u2013 parabolas and hyperbolas \u2013 important elements of Art Nouveau \u201cpanoply\u201d, give dynamism and rhythm to these buildings and artefacts.\nIt is fully expressed in decorative arts, design and architecture. The main ornamental characteristic is the asymmetric undulating line, terminated by an energetic whiplash.\nOradea may be considered one of the most representative centres of 1900 architecture in Romania; it can be compared with those of Secession architecture in Central Europe.\nLocated at the Romanian western border, Oradea was, at the beginning of the 20th century, part of the Central European Austro-Hungarian Empire and, thus, was influenced by the artistic currents of this space.\nThe buildings of the early 20th century are richly marked by Lechner and Vienna Secession influence, inheriting an important legacy from the great architects of the artistic movement of the late 19th century and the early 20th century. The architecture and habitat of Oradea are to be approached only in the context of Central European architecture.\nBy its independence and personality, Oradea has a place among the large great European families of the firmly contoured 1900 Art, especially regarding the area between the Citadel and the Main Railway Station. There are here rental buildings, (Moskovits Palace I and II, Apollo Palace, Stern Palace, Adorjan Houses I and II, Darvasy Palace), villas (La Roche, V\u00e1g\u00f3, Okany Schwartz), h\u00f4tels (Pannonia, Emke, Rimonoczy, Weiszlovics, Vulturul Negru), military buildings \u2013 on Armatei Rom\u00e2ne Street, industrial buildings and warehouses (beer-, spirit-, bricks-factories, electric plant\u2019s chimney), public institutions (City Hall, Palace of Orthodox Bishopry, Palace of Greek-Catholic Bishopry, Palace of Justice, banks, houses of commerce and industry etc.), signed by architects who have a prime place in the European 1900 Architecture record: Odon Lechner, Dezs\u0151 Jakab, Marcell Komor, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 and J\u00f3zsef V\u00e1g\u00f3, Val\u00e9r Mende, Ferenc Sztaril, Ferenc L\u00f6bl, K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Riman\u00f3czy Sr.and Jr., Anton Szallerbek. All these sites offer a very diverse research and development material.\nThese great architects brought in Oradea the influence of Vienna and Budapest through their work, featuring a new style, different from the academic ones, thus creating the premises of a stylistic diversification based on inventions and originality.\nLike many European cities, \u201cSmall Paris\u201d, as Oradea was named at the beginning of the last century, has a belle-\u00e9poque charm given by its Secession, eclectic, New-Romanian, Neoclassic and Baroque architecture. Not impressing by size or opulence, the buildings of Oradea have an aura of welfare, refinement and quality that imprints on the memory.\nThe early 20th century is well represented in the centre, but almost every zone of the city has something especially particular.\nThe history centre of the city has a great historical, cultural, architectural and urban planning heritage value. It includes settlements nuclei, architectural relics, monuments of architecture and urban planning beginning with the 16th century up to a well represented beginning of the 20th century, and none of the monuments is annoying or discordant.\nAnalyzing the unity of style and ornamentation as an intrinsic value of Art Nouveau, we can find a coherent style combining the architectural structure and its artistic means; stucco mouldings, statues and medallions, ironwork, stained glass, opaque and coloured glass \u2013 they all justify ornamentation as a principle of architecture, based on the value of the line, on the organic power of the plant and on the structural symbol.\nOradea architecture is a result of the values created by an extremely interesting and valuable ethnic mix, which materialized in a value exchange of a rare richness, and in a shared heritage of great majesty and beauty. In its evident and rare specificity, it appears to be exceptionally valuable.\nThe heritage represents here a unifying element, a social cohesion instrument, which engendered a cultural mosaic and an original synthesis, like the dialects of a language \u2013 the result is a stylistic dialect resulting from mutual embellishments and fertilizations.\nThis contribution, a Romanian stylistic intervention in an important European current, is worth a special attention and a significant promotion, to match the quality, generosity, authenticity and exceptional value of the harmonious resulting interlacing.\nThe authenticity of the place was very well kept and fed by the previous generations. If the local specificity is not well-preserved, much of the cultural identity, so important in identifying a people, will be lost.\nThe entire community must feel obliged to a greater attention and sensitivity concerning the heritage protection, and the authorities and experts must develop policies and actions to preserve such a valuable heritage.\nIt is necessary to study and know the different views of conservation, to carefully choose the appropriate ones, in order to avoid possible pitfalls that may stem from trying to maintain a balance between conservation and management of the historic city.\nThe beautiful city centre is worth visiting, as are the B\u0103ile Felix health spas, accessible by bus and located just outside the city.\nOther sites worth visiting include:\n- Baroque Palace of Oradea \u2013 today Muzeul \u021a\u0103rii Cri\u0219urilor, a wonderful Baroque museum with 365 famous windows. It was the Roman Catholic bishop's palace until 1945, when the Communist regime took the building into public ownership. It was returned to the Roman Catholic Church in 2003. Its collection includes many fossils of dinosaurs and birds from the bauxite mines at Cornet-Brusturi.\n- Roman Catholic Basilica-Cathedral of the Assumption of Mary, or simply \"Baroque Cathedral\" (\"Catedrala baroc\u0103\") \u2013 the largest Baroque cathedral in Romania, and home to a skull relic and 2 statutes of St. King Ladislaus I of Hungary.\n- Cetatea Oradea \u2013 Oradea's Fortress, with a pentagonal shape, is a fortification with walls of rock on some portions and wood towers situated at the gate and at the corners.\n- Biserica cu Lun\u0103 \u2013 a church unique in Europe, with an astronomical clock depicting the phases of the moon.\n- Pasajul Vulturul Negru \u2013 the \"Black Eagle Palace\" (or \"Eagle Palace\") shopping galleria, named after its famous stained glass eagle in the ceiling.\n- Ady Endre Museum \u2013 a museum dedicated to one of the greatest Hungarian poets and a native son.\n- Teatrul de Stat din Oradea|Teatrul de Stat \u2013 the State Theatre in the heart of the city, plans for which were designed by two Austrian architects who had built around 100 theaters and opera houses in Europe by the end of the 19th century.\n- Str. Republicii \u2013 one of the most beautiful streets of Transylvania, displaying a great number of Art Nouveau buildings.\n- Some 100 religious sites of different denominations in Oradea, including three synagogues (only one still in use) and the largest Baptist church in Eastern Europe, Emmanuel Baptist Church.\nCSM Oradea is Oradea's professional basketball club that plays in the country's 1st division, Liga Na\u021bional\u0103, competition that the club won in 2015 and also competed in international competitions such as Champions League. The team plays its home matches at the Arena Antonio Alexe.\nFC Bihor, founded in 1958, club colors were red and blue, and the logo includes the year 1902, when the first football match was played in Oradea in R\u00e9day Park, was the city's most representative club in the Romanian football system for 58 years, the club was dissolved in 2016, after important financial problems. CA Oradea (CAO), founded in 1910 became famous, after the annexation of Northern Transylvania by Hungary during WW II, the football club played in the Hungarian Championship under the Hungarian translation Nagyv\u00e1radi Atl\u00e9tikai Club (NAC), and won the championship at the end of the 1943\u20131944 season. CA Oradea is one of only two football clubs who played and won national championships in two countries (the other one is SK Rapid Wien). After FC Bihor dissolution CAO was refounded in the spring of 2017, at 54 years after its dissolution. In the late years another club appeared on the city's football stage, Luceaf\u0103rul Oradea, club that was founded in 2001 and now is playing in the Liga II, being the most representative football club of the city and Bihor County, at this moment.\nMany important footballers were born in Oradea over time, like: Iuliu Baratky, Cosmin B\u0103rc\u0103uan, Elem\u00e9r Berkessy, Zeno Bundea, Zoltan Cri\u0219an, Claudiu Ke\u0219er\u00fc, Attila Kun, Erik Lincar, Marius Popa, Paul Popovici, Francisc Spielmann, Albert Str\u00f6ck or Ion Zare.\nCSM Digi Oradea is Oradea's professional water polo club, it evolves in the Romanian Superliga, competition that it won 9 times in a row and also have a regular presence in LEN Champions League or LEN Euro Cup, being a finalist in the last one.\nOradea metropolitan area is a metropolitan area located in Western Romania, in the County of Bihor, Cri\u015fana Romania and was founded on 9 May 2005.\nThe metropolitan area comprises the city of Oradea and 8 adjacent communes:\n- Biharia\n- Bor\u015f\n- Cetariu\n- Nojorid\n- O\u015forhei\n- Paleu\n- S\u00e2nmartin\n- S\u00e2ntandrei.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 954, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 954, "length": 5939, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6893, "length": 429, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7322, "length": 2397, "sectionHeading": "Demographics | Jewish community", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 9719, "length": 1003, "sectionHeading": "Quarters", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 10722, "length": 1043, "sectionHeading": "Economy", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 11765, "length": 641, "sectionHeading": "Transport", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 12406, "length": 4138, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 16544, "length": 5635, "sectionHeading": "Architecture", "sectionLabel": "city.architecture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 22179, "length": 1881, "sectionHeading": "Tourist attractions", "sectionLabel": "city.tourism"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 24060, "length": 1883, "sectionHeading": "Sports", "sectionLabel": "city.sport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 25943, "length": 304, "sectionHeading": "Metropolitan area", "sectionLabel": "city.district"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton,_Mississippi", "type": "city", "title": "Newton, Mississippi", "abstract": "Newton is a city in Newton County, Mississippi.

According to another theory, the city bears the name of the river with the same name, that is supposed to be of Ukrainian origin.\nIn Old German the city was known as Sedschopff, in modern German sources it can be found under such variations as Sotschen, Sutschawa or Suczawa, in Hungarian as Szucs\u00e1va (] ) or Sz\u0151csv\u00e1s\u00e1r, in Polish as Suczawa, in Ukrainian as \u0421\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0432\u0430 (] ), while in Yiddish as \u05e9\u05d0\u05b8\u05e5' (] ).\nFor nearly 200 years the city of Suceava was the capital of the Principality of Moldavia and the main residence of the Moldavian princes (between 1388 and 1565). The city was the capital of the lands of Stephen the Great, one of the pivotal figures in Romanian history, who died in Suceava in 1504. During the rule of Alexandru L\u0103pu\u015fneanu, the seat was moved to Ia\u015fi in 1565 and Suceava failed to become the capital again. Michael the Brave captured the city in 1600 during the Moldavian Magnate Wars as he became the ruler of Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania, but he was defeated the same year.\nTogether with the rest of Bukovina, Suceava was under the rule of the Habsburg Monarchy (later Austria-Hungary) from 1775 to 1918; the border of Habsburg domains passed just south-east of the city. At the end of World War I, it became part of Greater Romania.\nDuring the communist period in Romania, Suceava was heavily industrialized.\nThe city covers two types of geographical areas, the hills (of which the highest is Zamca Hill) and the meadows of the Suceava River valley. The unique setting of the urban settlement includes two groves, Zamca and \u0218ipote, which are both located within the city limits. Burdujeni, one of the neighbourhoods, is connected to the rest of the city by a prominent avenue, which makes the neighbourhood appear to be a separate satellite town.\nAt the 1930 census, the recorded population amounted to c. 17,000 inhabitants with the following ethno-linguistic composition:\n- Romanians: 60.2%\n- Germans (Bukovina Germans): 16.7%\n- Jews: 15.4%\n- Ukrainians: 3.7%\n- Poles: 2.0%\nAs of 2011 census data, Suceava has a population of 92,121, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census (105,865), making it the 23rd largest city in Romania. The ethnic makeup was as follows:\n- Romanians: 98.3%\n- Roma: 0.7%\n- Ukrainians: 0.3%\n- Germans (Bukovina Germans): 0.2%\n- Poles: 0.1%\n- Lipovans: 0.1%\n- Other: 0.3%\nThe city's current local council has the following political composition, according to the results of the 2016 local elections in Romania:\nSuceava is the place of several medieval sites that are closely linked with the history of Principality of Moldavia. The most significant and the best preserved in time is the Seat Fortress of Suceava (Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei) or Suceava Citadel, a medieval castle situated on the eastern edge of the contemporary city. The fortress was built during the reign of Petru II of Moldavia (1375-1391), also known as Petru Mu\u0219at, and then expanded and strengthened during the reign of Alexander I of Moldavia (1400-1432) and Stephen the Great (1457-1504). The medieval castle was part of the fortification system built in Moldavia in the late 14th century, because of the emergence of the Ottoman danger. It became strong enough to hold off an attack by Ottoman sultan Mehmed II (the conqueror of Constantinople), in 1476. \nSuceava was the capital city of the former Principality of Moldavia between 1388 and 1565. During this period, the castle served as princely residence. Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu moved the capital to Ia\u0219i in 1565, so the castle lost its status. After this moment, the citadel entered a period of decline. In 1675, during the reign of voivode Dumitra\u0219cu Cantacuzino, the fortress was destroyed. Then, for over two centuries the castle was deserted. In late 19th century and early 20th century, under the patronage of Austrian architect Karl Adolf Romstorfer, it took place rehabilitation works and archaeological researches. Between 1961 and 1970 other restoration and consolidation works were carried out. In 2013 a major reconstruction program was launched, to return the castle to its original architecture and shape.\nThe Seat Fortress of Suceava consists of two concentric citadels. The inner citadel, known as fortul mu\u0219atin, has a rectangular shape and a patio. It was built by Petru Mu\u0219at in late 14th century. In the second half of the 15th century, Stephen the Great expanded the structure, by adding another citadel that has a circular shape and surrounds the old one. After 1476, new fortifications were added to the outer citadel. The whole castle is encircled by a large defensive ditch. Today, the fortress is a landmark of Suceava and a touristic attraction.\nThe Princely Court of Suceava (Curtea Domneasc\u0103 din Suceava) was built and developed related with the Seat Fortress. In late 14th century, voivode Petru Mu\u0219at built the Princely House, a structure made in wood, which included a cellar. After 1400, Alexander I of Moldavia rebuilt the wooden house and added a surrounding wall made of stone and a complex of buildings, also made of stone. In the second half of the 15th century, the Princely Court was severely affected by fire, the wooden house being completely burned out. \nDuring his reign, Stephen the Great (1457-1504) restored the whole complex. A new Princely House was built, this time made of stone, and the other buildings were extended. Vasile Lupu (1634-1653) was the last ruler of Moldavia who took care of the Princely Court. During his time, the cellars were rehabilitated. The complex was abandoned in late 17th century, the buildings and the walls being gradually dismantled. Currently, on the site of the Princely Court there are only ruins and leftovers of the former buildings.\nThe ruins of the former medieval court are located in the city center of Suceava. In the 14th-17th centuries, in the proximity of the Princely Court there were built several churches that still exist today and attract tourists.\nOn the north-western edge of the modern city, on a hilltop, there is another medieval citadel known as \u0218cheia Fortress (Cetatea \u0218cheia) or the Western Fortress of Suceava (Cetatea de Apus a Sucevei). Unlike the Seat Fortress, currently \u0218cheia Fortress has left nothing but some ruins. The citadel was built during the reign of Petru Mu\u0219at in late 14th century, but was short-lived, because it was dismantled in early 15th century, during the reign of Alexander I of Moldavia. \u0218cheia Fortress, like the Seat Fortress, was part of the fortification system built in Moldavia in the late 14th century.\nThe first museum in Suceava was opened in 1900, by the initiative of some local intellectuals. In the beginning, the museum included only a few collections that were obtained as a result of the researches and excavation works at the Seat Fortress of Suceava. The museum was expanded and developed over time and became an important cultural institution, currently named Bukovina Museum (Muzeul Bucovinei). It has several departments and administers the medieval sites of the Seat Fortress, \u0218cheia Fortress and the Princely Court, local museums (Bukovina Village Museum, the history, ethnographic and natural sciences museums), the memorial houses of Simion Florea Marian in Suceava, Nicolae Labi\u0219 in M\u0103lini, Eusebiu Camilar in Ude\u0219ti and Ciprian Porumbescu in Stupca, and two traditional houses located in Solca and Bilca.\nThe oldest department of Bukovina Museum is the history museum, which was the backbone for creating a county museum at Suceava. This museum presents the local history of Suceava and Moldavia in the context of Romanian national history. The exhibits of the history museum and the offices of Bukovina Museum are located in a historic building, in the city center. The building, which hosted the prefecture of Suceava County during the interwar period, was built between 1902-1903. Since 1968, it houses the history museum. In 2014, the building and the museum entered an extensive program of modernization, rehabilitation and expansion.\nAt the history museum there is a reconstitution of a scene from the former throne hall located in the Seat Fortress. The scene presents some notable people from the history of Moldavia, made in glass fiber: Stephen the Great (ruler of Moldavia), Maria Voichi\u021ba (his third wife), Bogdan III the One-Eyed (his son and successor to the throne), officials of that time. The scene chosen to be reconstructed is an allotment of land for peasants. The reconstitution is based on medieval documents, frescoes and archaeological researches.\nBukovina Village Museum (Muzeul Satului Bucovinean) is an open-air museum that highlights the traditional cultural and architectural heritage of Bukovina region. It is located in the eastern part of Suceava, near the Seat Fortress. It was founded in the '70s, but its major expansion and development took place after 1990. The museum is designed as a traditional village in Bukovina, containing houses and various objectives from the ethnographic areas of R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi, Humor, C\u00e2mpulung Moldovenesc, Dorna and F\u0103lticeni. The museum includes among others a water mill from M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului, a traditional blacksmith workshop, a pottery workshop from Marginea and one of the many old wooden churches in northern Moldavia: Church of the Ascension, a Romanian Orthodox wooden church built in 1783 in Vama, a village in Suceava County. The bell tower is also made in wood, and dates from 1787. The church and the bell tower were both relocated in 2001, and currently are part of the museum.\nBesides Bukovina Village Museum, another museum that reflects the traditional life in this part of Romania is the ethnographic museum. It was opened in 1968 and includes old collections and exhibits that are housed in a medieval inn located in the center of Suceava, known as the Princely Inn of Suceava (Hanul Domnesc din Suceava). This landmark dates from the late 16th century and early 17th century. It was built of stone and has two floors and a cellar. During the Austrian rule (1775-1918), the inn operated as a hunting lodge for the imperial family. Since 1968, it hosts the ethnographic museum. The Princely Inn is the oldest civic building in Suceava which had not been seriously affected by time and maintained its original architecture.\nThe natural sciences museum was founded in 1976-1977, being the newest museum in Suceava. It highlights the flora and fauna of the surrounding area. The museum's rare exhibits and collections are housed in an old building, located in the central park of the city and built between 1811-1814. In the past, before being an attraction for visitors, the building operated as a school for boys.\nAlong with all these museums, Bukovina Museum includes memorial houses of some writers and artists born in this area of the country. The memorial house of Simion Florea Marian (Casa memorial\u0103 Simion Florea Marian) is the only one located in Suceava, the other ones being in the surrounding area. The memorial house operates as a museum. It was opened in 1974 in the home where Romanian priest and writer Simion Florea Marian lived, from 1884 until 1907, when he died. The museum hosts a collection that contains over 10,000 volumes, over 450 collections of magazines and newspapers, of which 150 are from Bukovina, manuscripts, letters, cultural and historical documents, old photos. In front of the memorial house it was opened a small park with a statue dedicated to Simion Florea Marian.\nOne of the most important cultural sites in Suceava is Saint John the New Monastery which includes the monumental Church of Saint George built between 1514 and 1522. The construction began during the reign of voivode Bogdan III the One-Eyed of Moldavia, after the nearby Mir\u0103u\u021bi Church (the metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia at that moment) was devastated in 1513. The construction was completed by Stephen IV of Moldavia (also known as \u0218tef\u0103ni\u021b\u0103). The monastery church served as metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia until 1677. It has frescoes painted on the outside, typical of the region, and is one of eight buildings that make up the churches of Moldavia UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since 1991 Saint John the New Monastery serves as the cathedral of the Archdiocese of Suceava and R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi. Saint John the New was a Moldavian monk who preached during Turkish occupation and was subsequently martyred in Cetatea Alb\u0103, present-day Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi in Ukraine. Alexander I of Moldavia brought his relics to Suceava in 1402.\nMir\u0103u\u021bi Church, dedicated to Saint George, is the oldest religious building in Suceava, founded by Petru II of Moldavia in late 14th century, in the same period with the Seat Fortress, when he moved the capital from Siret to Suceava. The church established the city as a see of it. Mir\u0103u\u021bi was the metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia between 1402 and 1522, when the church of Saint John the New Monastery was completed. In 1402 the relics of Saint John the New were transferred to this church from Cetatea Alb\u0103, and then, in 1589 transferred again to the nearby monastery church by voivode Peter the Lame. The name Mir\u0103u\u021bi derives from the fact that it was the coronation church of Moldavia until 1522. Stephen the Great was crowned in here in 1457. After the church was devastated, it was rebuilt in early 17th century, and then, in the 18th century, abandoned.\nChurch of Saint Demetrius was founded by Peter IV Rare\u0219, ruler of Moldavia (1527-1538, 1541-1546), and the son of Stephan the Great. The church was built in 1534-1535, with a bell tower added in 1560-1561 by Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu. The bell tower is 40 meters high, being the tallest bell tower in Suceava and a landmark of the city. The church had frescoes painted on the outside, that are still visible on one side wall. The frescoes inside were restored recently. Church of Saint Demetrius is located near the ruins of the former Princely Court of Suceava.\nFurthermore, there is another old church near these ruins. Church of Saint John the Baptist, also known as Coconilor Church or Domni\u021belor Church, was founded in 1643 by Vasile Lupu, voivode of Moldavia between 1632 and 1653. It has no exterior frescoes and a short bell tower that has its roof linked with the roof above the church. In its early days, the church functioned as a chapel for the Princely Court.\nChurch of the Resurrection (located in the proximity of Saint John the New Monastery) dates from 1551, and was founded by Elena Rare\u0219, the wife of voivode Peter IV Rare\u0219. The church has no tower above the naos, its architecture reflecting the urban style of the medieval period. Instead of the bell tower, the church has a zvonnitsa, an architectural form especially used in the Russian architecture of the 14th-17th centuries. Church of the Resurrection was used by the local Roman Catholic community during the Habsburg occupation, and then by the Ruthenian Greek Catholic community, until 1936. It is also known as V\u0103scresenia Church or Elena Doamna Church.\nChurch of Saint Nicholas (Pr\u0103jescu) is another religious building in Suceava that features the medieval Moldavian architectural style. The present church was rebuilt by treasurer Nicoar\u0103 Pr\u0103jescu in 1611, during the reign of Constantin Movil\u0103 (1607-1611). Throughout its history, the church functioned as a necropolis for the local boyars.\nBetween the city center and I\u021bcani neighborhood, on the slopes that descend to Suceava River valley, there is Church of the Assumption, another old Romanian Orthodox church, founded in the first half of the 17th century (1639). The church was built on the place where I\u021bcani Monastery existed before. It functioned as a nunnery until late 18th century. Today it is parish church, and has a zvonnitsa similar to that of Church of the Resurrection, located downtown.\nIn Burdujeni neighborhood, north-east of the city center, there is Teodoreni Monastery, founded in 1597 by local boyar Teodor Movil\u0103, the elder brother of Ieremia Movil\u0103, ruler of Moldavia (1595-1600, 1600-1606). Burdujeni village (now a district of Suceava) was established and developed around this monastery. The set of buildings includes Church of Ascension, the bell tower, living quarters for nuns and a surrounding wall. Just north of Teodoreni Monastery, in the old district of Burdujeni, there is Church of the Holy Trinity, founded by archimandrite Filaret Scriban in 1851.\nI\u021bcani neighborhood has two Romanian Orthodox churches founded in the first half of the 20th century: Church of the Holy Archangels (built near Suceava North railway station, in 1933-1938) and Church of the Holy Apostles (located on European route E85 and built in 1905-1908 by the German community of I\u021bcani, initially as a Lutheran church).\nChurch of the Holy Cross, located in P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi village (a few miles north-west of I\u021bcani), was founded in 1487 by Stephen the Great, and is one of the monuments that make up the churches of Moldavia UNESCO World Heritage Site. Also not far away from I\u021bcani, there is Dragomirna Monastery, established by clergyman Anastasie Crimca in 1609. Vorone\u021b Monastery is located west of Suceava, in the town of Gura Humorului.\nDuring the late Modern Age until the mid 20th century a sizable German community lived in Suceava. They were of both Roman Catholic and Evangelical Lutheran faith given the fact that they had a diverse geographic background. Several religious buildings that served for both aforementioned categories can be still found today both in the city proper and in the I\u021bcani neighborhood.\nSuceava had an important Armenian community which is highlighted by several religious buildings that still exist today. The most representative landmark established by the local Armenians is Zamca Monastery, a fortified complex of buildings located on a plateau at the western point of the contemporary city. Zamca Monastery was constructed between 1551 and 1606 and its church is dedicated to Saint Auxentie. Along with the church, the monastery includes several buildings made of stone and a defensive wall that surrounds the whole medieval complex.\nBetween Zamca Monastery and the city center there are two more Armenian Orthodox churches. Church of Saint Simon (also known as The Red Tower Church because of its bell tower) was founded in 1513. The bell tower was constructed in 1551. The church has an old Armenian cemetery in the proximity and a chapel that was built in 1902 (Pruncul Chapel).

In 1907, ranchers Patrick and John Landergin purchased a part of the LS Ranch from Swift & Company. Working in association with the Amarillo-based Pool Land Company, the Landergin brothers brought more prospective settlers to the community. The following year, they established a bank in Vega. When the railroad was completed, Vega began to thrive. There were several stores, a blacksmith, two churches, and a newspaper \u2013 the Vega Sentinel \u2013 operating in the community by early 1909.\nThe nearby town of Tascosa, which was designated Oldham County seat in 1880, declined in both importance and population as Vega grew. A five-year battle over which community should serve as Oldham County's seat of government was put to a vote in 1915. In the special election, citizens chose to move the county seat from Tascosa to Vega. Until a permanent courthouse was built, county business was conducted in Vega's Oldham Hotel.\nModern amenities, such as telephone service, were introduced during the 1920s. In 1926, Route 66 (superseded by Interstate 40) was commissioned as a link from Chicago to Los Angeles and ran through Vega along the Old Ozark Trail. The arrival of Route 66 provided an economic boost for the community. The Route 66 heritage is honored by a restored Magnolia gasoline station located adjacent to the courthouse, which appears as it would have in the 1920s or 1930s.\nVega was officially incorporated in 1927, and the population was 519 in the 1930 census. On May 3, 1931, a fire destroyed six buildings west of the courthouse square. Two months later, a second fire burned two buildings on the north side of the square. These fires prompted the town to establish a municipal water system.\nVega was home to 515 people in 1940, 619 in 1950, and 658 in 1960. By 1980, over one-third of the population of Oldham County resided in Vega. After a slight decline in the 1990s, the population had risen to 936 as of 2000.\nVega is located at (35.245547, -102.425112).

Lake Forest was founded around Lake Forest College and was laid out as a town in 1857 as a stop for travelers making their way south to Chicago.

Though considerably more accessible today, due in part to the extensive new construction taking place further west, the much smaller neighborhood of eastern Lake Forest, near the coast of Lake Michigan, remains relatively secluded and is one of the most scenic, historical, and architecturally significant suburbs of Chicago. These neighborhoods include estates and homes designed by distinguished architects like Howard Van Doren Shaw, David Adler, Frank Lloyd Wright, Arthur Heun, Jerome Cerny, Henry Ives Cobb, and modernist George Fred Keck among others. Landscape architects Frederick Law Olmsted and Jens Jensen also designed projects in Lake Forest. Market Square, designed by Howard Van Doren Shaw, was completed in 1916 as a commercial center for Lake Forest.\nThe secluded style of Lake Forest was no accident; indeed, it was a form of protection. According to the president of the Lake Forest-Lake Bluff Historical Society, the captains of industry and WASP elite who first settled in Lake Forest sought a refuge from a Chicago teeming with, in their view, immigrants with their dangerous socialist ideas and sinful alcoholic libations.\nCountry clubs became important centers of social activity in Lake Forest's early years, and the Onwentsia Club was, in the words of one writer, \"the premiere social and sporting club in the Midwest.\" One example of the activities that occurred there was an 1898 plantation-themed party, at which members dined on fried chicken, corn on the cob, and watermelon served by\u2014in keeping with the party's theme -- \"little colored girls.\" After-dinner entertainment included a minstrel show.\nOne of Lake Forest's most notable features is its virgin prairies and other nature preserves.

City council members used existing ordinances against obscenity\u2014defined in the codes as \"morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion\"\u2014to buttress their campaign. Mayor Charles Clarke stated, \"If they sell an obscene tape to somebody underage, we will prosecute.\" The person who came up most frequently in discussions of obscene content was then rapper since turned actor Ice-T.\nLake Forest has been named a Tree City USA by the National Arbor Day Foundation in recognition of its commitment to community forest.

Additionally, Lake Forest has two Metra commuter railroad stations, both of which share the same name. The Union Pacific/North Line has a station in East Lake Forest, while the Milwaukee District/North Line has a station in West Lake Forest.\nMost Lake Forest residents attend Lake Forest School District 67 and Lake Forest High School. Lake Forest High School serves Lake Forest as well as neighboring Lake Bluff and Knollwood.\nLake Forest is home to Citadel Theatre, the Lake Forest Symphony, the Music Institute of Chicago Lake Forest Campus and the Deer Path Art League.\nLake Forest is noted in the Chicago area for its history of polo, once being the westernmost establishment of the sport in the United States. It was home to the \"East-West clash of 1933\" in which a team of \"Westerners\", today Midwesterners, challenged the best of the Eastern US polo teams, winning two of three matches. Box seats sold for $5.50, and the general public was admitted for $1.10. The Chicago press covered the match extensively, right down to the arrival of every horse and player, the color of the horseflesh and the color of the goalposts.

The population was 1,632 at the 2010 census.\n", "text": "The town was originally included in the Chickasaw Nation, and is believed to be named after the great Chickasaw chief and warrior Itawamba Minco, who later acquired the name of Levi Colbert, who resided on Chickasaw land in Mississippi near Cotton Gin Port.\nMinco was originally settled sometime around 1890, several years before Oklahoma achieved statehood. In its early stages it was a very busy town because of its location at the end of the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad until the railroad was extended further south two years later. Charles B. Campbell owned the occupancy rights of the land that the town was built on. His wife was Miss Maggie (Margaret) Williams, a daughter of W. G. (Caddo Bill) Williams, owner of the Half Moon Ranch, who started Silver City in 1872 by building a trading store for those cattlemen driving their herds of cattle up the Chisholm Trail.\nBefore the establishment of Minco as a town, three major expeditions passed through the area. The first expedition was conducted by Captain Randolph Marcy in 1849. Marcy was ordered to escort 1,500 individuals headed to the California gold fields. When the expedition approached the Minco area they kept to the south side of Buggy Creek, which Marcy named \"Deer Creek\". Marcy named his route the Fort Smith to Santa Fe Trail. Interestingly enough there was a road established in 1839-1840 on the north side of the Canadian River that was also named the Fort Smith to Santa Fe Trail. This road had been laid out by Josiah Gregg, a Santa Fe merchant who had connections with merchants in Fort Smith, Arkansas.\nDuring the summer of 1853 the first railroad survey was conducted from Fort Smith to Los Angeles by Lt. Amiel Weeks Whipple. Whipple's survey followed Marcy's route from Fort Smith until they reached the Caddo County Buttes. At that point the expedition moved westward, whereas Marcy had turned north to join the Fort Smith to Santa Fe Trail not far north of Hydro, Oklahoma. Whipple continued westward, leaving Oklahoma just west of the Antelope Hills in Roger Mills County.\nThe Rock Island Railroad Co.'s original purpose in extending the railroad to Minco was to provide a gateway for the shipping of cattle from the grazing lands of the Chickasaw Nation, just to the south of the town. On August 4, 1901, the Chickasaw Nation's land was opened to white settlement, in turn making Minco a railroad hub for the entire region.\nOn October 14, 1901, local citizens formed a company for the purpose of selling vacant lots in the town to encourage settlement. It was known as the Minco Townsite and Investment Company.\nThe town was originally composed mainly of merchants who provided supplies for the many travelers that used the railroad infrastructure of the town. It is the oldest town in the western part of Oklahoma, so its many businesses served residents for many miles around. In fact, the hardware store and tin shop originally opened by Kirk Woodworth in 1891 is still in existence. The remains of some of the hotels that were used by the many temporary residents also still stand along its Main Street.\nIn September 1894 Meta Chestnutt, a teacher from North Carolina who was determined to bring education to the frontier (specifically Native Americans), along with the services of J.H. Bond, established the El Meta Bond College, one of the first of its kind in the area. The college offered elementary, grammar, and high school courses along with some music and drama courses. Having faced economic troubles for the whole of its existence, it was eventually decommissioned in 1920 due to decreasing enrollment since the arrival of newer educational institutions that came with statehood. After the demolition of the old school building a modern masonry armory was constructed in 1936 and today serves as a community gathering center. A community park occupies part of the old campus. In this park there is a plaque commemorating Meta Chestnutt and her contributions to the school.\nThe first municipal natural gas company in Oklahoma was founded in Minco in 1960 by James Burton Branum, Jr, operated along with the Minco Tag Agency from an office in the back of what was then Branum's Variety Store on Main street.\nIn 2007 the Minco Historical Society established a museum to exhibit the numerous historical facts associated with the town.\nMinco currently has two weekly newspapers. The Minco Millennium is located on the corner of Main Street and Highway 81 and has been publishing every week since the summer of 1998. The Minco-Union City Times is an award-winning newspaper that serves Minco and Union City.\nMinco's earlier newspapers and years of publication since origin are as follows:\n- Minco Minstrel, 1890-1897, 190?-1916, 1921\u20131999\n- Minco Monitor, 1892-1899\n- Minco Weekly, 1899-1900\n- Minco Herald, 1916-1921 (this time period fills in the Minstrel gap)\nMicrofilm copies of these papers are available at the Oklahoma Historical Society building, south of the state capital, on the second floor.\nConstruction began on a series of windfarms near Minco, named Minco I, Minco II, and Minco III, in 2012. As of 2017, the windfarms generate 300 megawatts of electricity, some of which is used to power Google's Mayes County, Oklahoma facility.\nMinco is located in northern Grady County at (35.315552, -97.945698). The city limits extend north to the Canadian River, which serves as the border with Canadian County. U.S. Route 81 passes through the center of town, leading north to El Reno and south to Chickasha, the Grady County seat. Oklahoma State Highway 37 leads east from the center of Minco to Tuttle and west from the northern part of Minco to Cogar. Oklahoma City is to the northeast of Minco.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.28%, is water.\nA sign at the city limits reads, \"Welcome to Minco, The Land of Milk and Honey\". It is based on the town having a large number of dairy farmers and Oklahoma's largest beekeeping company, Gibson-Ross Clover Bloom Honey. Every first Saturday of December the town brings in thousands of tourists to the Christmas Honey Festival. Jim Ross, owner of the Ross Honey Company, gives tours all day and shows the entire honey production process.\nA musical tour of the town by comic Lucas Ross can be seen here.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 1,672 people, 658 households, and 467 families residing in the city.

It is part of the Hattiesburg, Mississippi Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,164 at the 2000 census. It is the county seat of Lamar County. The Town of Purvis was incorporated on February 25, 1888 and was founded by and named after Thomas Melville Purves, originally of Marion County, Alabama. Purves, born March 8, 1820, was a second generation Scottish-American; his grandfather emigrated to Charleston, South Carolina in 1765.\n", "text": "Purvis acquired a land grant in 1870 for a parcel of real estate which was located, at that time, in Marion County, Mississippi. In 1871, Purves moved from his home in Greene County and homesteaded the , along with his wife, Dorothy Abney, born May 14, 1826 in Hinds County, and their five surviving children, to the rural property. Dorothy, also known as Dollie or Dolly, was a doctor who tended the sick of the area and delivered babies. Purves built a two-room log cabin for his family with an open fireplace in one room used for cooking and heating. John, Thomas Purves\u2019 third surviving child, was the town\u2019s first Mayor.\nIn 1884, the New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad gained right-of-way on Purves' property and a depot was erected, along with a marker, reading \u201cPurvis\u201d. There were various recognized spellings of Scottish Clan Purves (surname) with both names previously listed being only a few of many. Purves eventually changed the spelling of his surname to match the town\u2019s depot marker which you can see evidenced on his tombstone located in Fillingame Cemetery in Purvis. Purves built and ran the first boarding house for the men who were working on laying rails for the New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad. This building was called a \u201csection house\u201d because that is what a house built for railroad crew was termed at that time. Mrs. Anna Bufkin was a member of one of the first families to live in the section house as her husband was one that helped grade and build that part of the railroad in Purvis. There were around fifty men in the crew working in that area and the water supply was inadequate for that many additional people. They found a second source of water from a spring across the railroad track that was originally used by Thomas Purves (Grandpa Purvis) years before the town sprang into existence.\nLamar became a county on February 19, 1904 in House Bill 166 and was formed from the second Judicial District of Marion County. The county was named after Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II, who was elected to Mississippi Congress in 1872 and has one county each in Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia named after him. The town of Purvis was designated as the county seat of the county Lamar with the depot of the New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad listed as the town's center and the lines to run with the cardinal points of the compass.\nPurvis began as a sawmill town and is noted to be located on the highest point on the Southern Railroad between Meridian and New Orleans by James Bounds, land surveyor, MS REG # L.S.1021. The first homesteaders of the area farmed and would only have to make 2-3 trips to \u201ctown\u201d for supplies a year. The best route and the trading post most used was the Pass Christian trading post, some ninety miles south of the area which took eleven days in ox-cart to travel.\nJames Bounds, surveyor, stated:\u201cIt may be of interest to note the location of the old Pass Christian Road on a map of Stone and Pearl River Counties. This road was used very much by the early settlers of Lamar County to travel south to the coast for supplies. This road followed a natural divide between the water-sheds of Wolf River and Big Black Creek, of which the head waters originate in Lamar County. This road was one of necessity. It crossed no branches or streams of any kind and was one of the main roads of travel until modern means of transportation came into use after the American Civil War.\u201d\nWhen the town was in its infancy, lumber companies bought large tracts of virgin pine forested land and erected sawmills at sites along the newly developing rail line. A special meeting of the board of supervisors was held in January 1905, for the purpose of giving a contract for a new courthouse to be built for the sum of $43,516 to P.H. Weathers (architect) of Jackson, Mississippi. This two-story brick and stone building was to replace the frame courthouse that in use at the time. The new Lamar County Courthouse was completed in 1905 at a cost of $50,000 only to be damaged by the 1908 Dixie tornado outbreak, then subsequently demolished by fire in 1934. The building was reconstructed and expanded in 1956 but has fallen into disrepair in recent years. Lamar County Administrator Chuck Bennett stated on December 30, 2008 that the courthouse is slated for a complete renovation that could cost up to $44,000,000 and could take up to four years to complete. Preliminary work began in 2006 and some items have already been paid in full, such as engineering services and an asbestos study.\nPurvis is located at (31.142616, -89.407724).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and 0.25% is water. Because of a well-known system of aquifers and sand mines, this area was selected for \"project dribble\" to be the site of nuclear tests by the US government during 1961 to 1968 to measure seismic activity.\n- Major highways\n- Interstate 59\n- US 11 (MS)\n- Mississippi Highway 589\nPurvis is part of the area known as the Pine Belt (Mississippi) due to overwhelming number of longleaf pine trees that populate the forests. \nPurvis is located in the Deep South, in a humid subtropical area of the country with hot summers and mild winters. Located in USDA Hardiness Zone 8, the climate supports a large variety of foliage and plants. Purvis receives about 62 inches of rain annually, January being the wettest month averaging , which provides for the lush growth of native plants and trees. January is also the coldest month of the year with an average temperature of 60 degrees during the daytime and 36 degrees at night.\nSummers are long with 80 degree temperatures beginning in May or sometimes sooner and lasting normally until the first weeks of October. Night temperatures do not usually vary greatly from daytime temperatures, usually dropping only 21 -24 degrees. Heat indexes can soar during the summer months due to high humidity and long hours of sunshine, causing a 93 degree day to feel as if it were 101 degrees. Afternoon showers and thunderstorms are to be expected during summer months but are often short lived. July is, on average, the hottest month of the year at 92 degrees, without counting the varying heat index.\nSnowfall is rare and when it does occur it usually is only or less. Purvis averages freezing temperatures only a few times a winter. The record high was in 1951 at 106 degrees and the record low in 1985 at 4 degrees. On February 23, 2016, a tornado hit Purvis, killing one.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 2,164 people, 786 households, and 577 families residing in the city. The population density was 551.0 people per square mile (212.6/km\u00b2). There were 844 housing units at an average density of 214.9 per square mile (82.9/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the city was 70.84% White, 27.68% African American, 0.18% Native American, 0.14% Asian, 0.23% from other races, and 0.92% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.06% of the population.\nThere were 786 households out of which 34.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 48.2% were married couples living together, 20.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.5% were non-families. 24.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 11.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females there were 90.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 82.8 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $30,938, and the median income for a family was $35,000. Males had a median income of $27,571 versus $17,500 for females. The per capita income for the city was $13,727. About 11.3% of families and 14.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 20.0% of those under age 18 and 13.6% of those age 65 or over.\nThe United States Postal Service operates the Purvis Post Office in Purvis.\nThe Mississippi Department of Mental Health operates the South Mississippi State Hospital in unincorporated Lamar County, near Purvis.\nThe Purvis School System\u2019s mascot is a tornado as a testament of the courage of those who endured the Tornadoes of 1908, which changed the face of the emerging town, and in honor of those who lost their lives that day. The city of Purvis is serviced by the Lamar County School District which includes the following:\n- Purvis Lower Elementary School K-2\n- Purvis Upper Elementary School 3-5\n- Purvis Middle School 6-8\n- Purvis High School 9-12\nPrivate Schools include:\n- Lamar Christian School\n- Bass Memorial Academy\nThe citizens of Purvis have contributed greatly to the various branches of the United States Military beginning long before the town was incorporated. The War Memorial located on the grounds of the Old Lamar County Courthouse holds testament of the sacrifices the families of the area have made. The Purvis City Park is dedicated to the men and women who served in World War II and one of the main thoroughfares through the city is named in honor of one of its decorated servicemen.\nOn April 24, 1908, three F4 (207-260 mph) tornadoes left a line of destruction from Livingston Parish, Louisiana northeast to Wayne County. This line of storms left 143 people dead, with 83 dead in Purvis alone. From the reports of Dr. H.R. Hermesch, Assistant Surgeon U.S. Navy and the Relief Committee at Purvis, we know that there were 83 dead, 340 wounded and 1935 destitute in the town of Purvis. The large \u201cTown Clock\u201d in the domed tower of the courthouse of the time, sustained damage from flying debris and was stopped at 2:13 in the afternoon. \nAn excerpt from the booklet \u201cThe Purvis Tornado\u201d by the Lamar County Historical Society, 2004:\n\u201cThe first thought was of Hattiesburg for help. All the wires were down, and they could not telegraph this city for help, so Sheriff George W. Holleman saddled his horse and W.B. Alsworth mounted the steed, and started across the country for Richburg, 10 miles distance toward Hattiesburg. Mr. Alsworth urged the horse for all he was worth, dashing three veritable creeks, and over rough roads. He made the trip in less than fifty minutes. A second messenger was sent behind Mr. Alsworth, so that if anything happened, the other man might reach the goal and send the news. The other messenger was J.C. Calhoun. Both men reached Richburg about 3 o\u2019clock, Mr. Alsworth sometime ahead of Mr. Calhoun.\nAlsworth wired direct over the telephone to Mayor J.D. Donald, asking for physicians to come to the relief of the stricken town.\nMayor Donald immediately made the fact known in the city. A special train over the North Eastern was the result. Thus the new of the terrible disaster was communicated to the outside world.\u201d\nThe depot of the New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad, which was responsible for the success of the bustling, growing town, was one of the first public buildings demolished by the twisters and was thrown across the tracks. Railroad cars standing in front of the depot were carried away by the winds. Over 115 businesses, buildings and homes were completely demolished or partially destroyed and the entire African-American section of town was wiped out. The Purvis High School graduating Class of 1908\u2019s commencement exercises were due to start the night the tornado hit and part of the exercises had been previously performed the morning of the tornado. The morning exercises were completed at the two story brick schoolhouse on Mitchell Street just one hour before the storm hit and had it lasted one hour longer, the death toll would have been far greater for the entire second floor of the schoolhouse was removed by the twister.\nPurvis has felt the winds of quite a few tropical systems over the years; especially considering how many miles from the Mississippi Gulf Coast the city is located. Category 3 Hurricane Ethel came in 1960 but died down to a tropical storm by the time she had reached the area. Hurricane Hilda in 1964 was not a Category 4 but an extratropical low when she deposited rain in Lamar County. Due to the close proximity of Lamar County to Louisiana, Hurricane Betsy in 1965 also left Purvis some rain. The eye of Hurricane Camille came directly over Lamar County in 1969 and was the largest, costliest and most deadly hurricane to hit the Mississippi Gulf Coast until the monster storm Katrina in 2005. Hurricane Edith came in 1971, followed by Hurricane Carmen in 1974 that drenched us with of rain before heading off to Texas. Hurricane Bob made an appearance in 1979 but was quickly forgotten when Hurricane Elena made her way over the area in 1985 as a Category 3 storm. That same year, Purvis received more rain than wind from Category 1 Hurricane Juan. Hurricane Florence passed by in 1988, leaving only rain as a weakening Category 1 storm. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew had thankfully died down from its original Category 5 when it came over and dropped of rain. Hurricane Georges gave Purvis 5\u20137 inches of precipitation in 1998, and also some wind before curving back over Alabama. Tropical Storm Allison oddly stayed together long enough to still have an eye like feature over Purvis after traveling from Texas and Louisiana in 2001 and dumped 10\u201315 inches of rain on Lamar County.\nMississippi felt the effects of The Hurricane in 2005, Hurricane Katrina, which hit the area as a weakening Category 2 hurricane after reaching Category 5 strength in the Gulf of Mexico. This storm killed 1836 people, 238 of them in Mississippi. The effects from this hurricane can still be seen four years later in the forests around Purvis. Hurricane Gustav passed a little south of the area in 2008 but was close enough to leave wind and rain in its wake.\nVela Uniform was an element of Project Vela conducted jointly by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) and the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). Its purpose was to develop seismic methods for detecting underground nuclear testing.\nThe Project Dribble program involved two nuclear detonations called Salmon and Sterling that were conducted within Tatum Salt Dome southwest of the Hattiesburg/Purvis area in the late 1960s.\nThe Sterling Event was the fourth nuclear detonation involved in a study, identified as Project Dribble, sponsored by the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Project Agency. Project Dribble involved the recording and identification of seismic signals from underground detonations. These studies are part of a seismic research program called Vela Uniform which is designed to improve the United States' capability to detect, identify, and locate underground nuclear detonations.\nProject Dribble's purpose was to give U.S. scientists experience in detecting underground nuclear tests in the Soviet Union. The first blast, a 5.3 kiloton bomb, took place in 1964 at the bottom of a shaft southwest of Hattiesburg and four miles (6 km) northeast of Baxterville. The second bomb, much smaller, was exploded two years later within the cavity created by the first blast.\nReferenced in the song \"Mississippi\" off the CD The Good Times by Afroman.

In the first two years of its settlement, the townsite was successful; by 1858 the population reached 776. However the townsite was located in Comanche territory and raids were common. Also the hardships of the American Civil War forced citizens to leave. The population declined until 1871 when it grew after Stephenville became an agriculture and livestock center. Coal mining also became important to the area in 1886 and was a major segment of the economy for the following three decades.\nStephenville was incorporated in 1889, with the arrival of the Fort Worth and Rio Grande Railway.

Bend's metro population was estimated at 165,954 as of July 1, 2013. The Bend MSA is the fifth largest metropolitan area in Oregon.\nBend is located on the eastern edge of the Cascade Range along the Deschutes River. Here the Ponderosa Pine forest transitions into the high desert, characterized by arid land, junipers, sagebrush, and bitter-brush. Originally a crossing point on the river, settlement began in the early 1900s. Bend was incorporated as a city in 1905. Economically, it started as a logging town but is now identified as a gateway for many outdoor sports, including mountain biking, fishing, hiking, camping, rock climbing, white-water rafting, skiing, paragliding, and golf. In 2015, Men's Journal ranked Bend as one of The 10 Best Places to Live Now.\n", "text": "The name Bend was derived from \"Farewell Bend\", the designation used by early pioneers to refer to the location along the Deschutes River where the town was eventually platted, one of the few fordable points along the river.\nUntil the winter of 1824, the Bend area was known only to Native Americans who hunted and fished there. That year, members of a fur trapping party led by Peter Skene Ogden visited the area. John C. Fr\u00e9mont, John Strong Newberry, and other Army survey parties came next. Then pioneers heading farther west passed through the area and forded the Deschutes River at Farewell Bend.\nConstructed in May 1901, the Pilot Butte Development Company's little plant was the first commercial sawmill in Bend. The original location was at the rear of the Pilot Butte Inn of later years. Steidl and Reed also set up a small mill in Bend in 1903. This was on the Deschutes River just below the Pioneer Park area. The mill was operated by water power. A small community developed around the area, and in 1904, a city was incorporated by a general vote of the community's 300 residents. On January 4, 1905, the city held its first official meeting as an incorporated municipality, appointing A. H. Goodwillie as the first mayor. The settlement was originally called \"Farewell Bend\", which was later shortened to \"Bend\" by the U.S. Postal Service.\nIn 1910, Mirror Pond was created by the construction of the Bend Water, Light & Power Company dam on the Deschutes River in Bend.

However, construction activity in Bend appears to be slowing - the number of building permit applications received by the Bend City Building Division fell from 826 in August 2006 to 533 in August 2007, a 35 percent decrease.\nA large influx of new residents drawn by Bend's lifestyle amenities, along with the low interest rates and easy lending that fostered a national housing boom in 2001\u221205, resulted in increased activity in Bend's construction and real estate sectors and have caused the rate of home price appreciation in Bend to grow substantially during that period. Median home prices in the Bend MSA increased by over 80% in the 2001\u221205 period.\nIn June 2006, Money magazine named the Bend MSA the fifth most overpriced real estate market in the United States.

It is one of the three cities in Batangas aside from Batangas City and Tanauan). It is located south of Manila and is the largest city of Batangas with a population of people according to the ? .\nThe city is named after a species of tree in the Urticaceae family, lipa (Dendrocnide meyeniana), known for the stinging trichomes on its twigs.\nLipa City is a recreational, religious, commercial, industrial and educational center. The city hosts the site of the 1940's apparition of the Virgin Mary.\nThe city is also home to the Fernando Air Base, headquarters of the Philippine Air Force's Air Education and Training Command (AETC), known in military circles as the Baguio of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The summer camp of the Air Force of the Philippines.\nThe Southern Tagalog Arterial Road (STAR) and South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) provide access to Batangas City and Metro Manila.\n", "text": "Batangue\u00f1os from the early years had their settlement in Bombon Lake and began dispersing to other places when the volcano erupted. While a group of people was moving to another settlement area, the image of St. Sebastian was stolen from them and later on was found on a tree called \u201clipa\u201d. People believed that the patron saint wished to name that place \u201cLipa\" .\nThe primal composition in the southeastern region of Bombon Lake were elements of the dispersed colonial families founded by Datus Dumangsil and Balkasusa in Taal, Batangas, between the 10th and 13th century AD. These pioneer settlers under the leadership of the fleeing Datu Puti, chief of state of the then mighty Srivijaya Empire, purchased the lowlands from King Marikudo of the Mountain Province at his kingdom. The purchased lands consisted of Panay in the Visayas and the lowlands in Luzon including Batangas. The ten (10) Bornean Datus divided among themselves the purchased lands, the Batangas Bay were apportioned among the Dumangsil and Balkasusa Clans.\nIt is however subject to conjecture whether the pre-historic Negritos 12,000 to 15,000 years age or the much later waves of Austronesian seafarers from 5,000 to 300 B.C. were able to settle along the coasts of Batangas into the inner lake region of Taal which was accessible to navigation through the Pansipit River, thus, the possibility of miscegenetic marriages and cross culture among the aboriginal inhabitants, the old settlers and the latter Dumangsil and Balkasusa Clans. Or whether violent wars had been waged between old inhabitants and new colonizers is uncertain too, incontrovertible proofs being wanting.\nOut of this Bornean Tribe of the Dumangsil and Balkasusa Clan was born the ancestry of Lipa and as later on their descendants spread out towards Laguna de Bay and Bicol Peninsula. The remains excavated from their ancient settlements in Butong, Taal, Calatagan Bay Area and Balayan attest to the fact of their presence in the said site at least in the latter part of the 12th century down to the coming of Goiti and Legaspi in Batangas in 1570. The flourishing trade relations between these early Batangue\u00f1os with a number of Chinese merchants prior to the Spanish conquest explained the presence of hundreds of Chinese wares from potteries to stonewares and vases of Song dynasty period to the latter part of the 16th century, in the burial grounds at Calatagan sites of Pulung Bakaw, Kay Tomas, Pinagpatayan I and II at Butong, Taal Batangas.\nBy origin the early Lipe\u00f1os were Buddhist in religion and Indian in civilization. With its not infrequent contact with the Chinese traders, the Batangue\u00f1os have absorbed and been influenced too by China. With the Spanish colonization of the Philippines and the Salcedo conquest of Batangas in 1572, the Lipe\u00f1os were forced to embrace Western Civilization.\nAt the coming of the Spaniards to Batangas in 1570, the Malay settlements along the southern shores of Taal Lake at Tagbakin was inhabited by the warlike descendants of the two (2) datus called the Tagalogs. In 1605, after Marshall Gabriel de Rivera received the encomienda of Bombon, the Augustinian Fathers made Tagbakin the first settlement of the Lipe\u00f1os and a mission center with the name of San Sebastian, perhaps after the installed Patron Saint, which continued to the present. The settlement was made a regular municipality in 1702 and a regular parish in 1716 with Fray Diego de Alday as the first curate.\nWith the eruption of Taal Volcano in 1724, the people moved to what is now \"Lumang Lipa\" and, again, in 1754, they moved to Balete where they settled for two years until 1756 when they moved inland to the present site obviously for more security from volcanic eruptions.\nWhen Don Galo de los Reyes was the governadorcillo of Lipa, he introduced the cultivation of coffee. The seeds of the Arabica species were said to be of two chupas brought in from Mexico by an Agustinian missionary. The coffee industry so flourished and made Lipa the richest municipality in the country with an annual income of P4,000,000.00 that on October 21, 1887 the Queen regent Maria Christina, acting for the young King Alfonso XIII, signed a decree elevating Lipa to a city known as \"Villa de Lipa\", and later authorized to use a coat of arms by the Royal Overseas Minister Don V\u00edctor Balaguer.\nAt the celebration of the elevation of Lipa to a city in January 1888, Jos\u00e9 Rizal was invited by Dr. Jose Lozada, Catalino Dimayuga and the brothers Celestino and Simeon Luz but Rizal responded only with his Hymno Al Trabajo which he dedicated to the zeal and industry of the Lipe\u00f1os.\nThe raising of cacao was introduced in Lipa by an Augustinian priest, Father Ignacio de Mercado, and that was the beginning of its cultivation throughout the Philippines.\nThe Lipe\u00f1os also engaged themselves in livestock raising and varied home crafts for men, and small industries, like weaving, embroidery and sewing for women. After World War II, citrus production prevailed until 1970 and, after its decline, about 1965, poultry and swine raising began to take roots and to thrive in no small degree until the present.\nThe first newspaper in Batangas, published in Spanish, was the Lumubog-Lumutang, printed in Lipa in 1889, and established by the well-known writers Cipriano Kalaw, Gregorio Katigbak, Benito Reyes, Hugo Latorre and Pedro Laygo. Other pioneer Spanish writers were Bernardo Solis, Catalino Dimayuga and Manuel Luz. During the revolution, Gregorio Aguilera Solis edited a newspaper Columnas Voluntas de la Federacion Malaya. This paper became the media for notable poems and literary works of Albino Dimayuga, Baldomero Roxas, Luis Lina Kison, Bernardo Solis, Benedicto Solis, Emiliano Manguiat and Petronio Katigbak. Roman Dimayuga wrote plays, while Pedro Laygo published articles on domestic and international politics and Tomas Umali on military affairs. Hispanistas during the American regime included national figures like Teodoro Kalaw, Fidel Reyes, Arsenio Luz, Max B. Solis, Enrique Laygo and Claro M. Recto. Lipe\u00f1os also served in the Revolutionary Republic. These were Gregorio Aguilera who was delegate to the Malolos Congress; Ceferino Pantoja, also a member of that congress; Jose Lozada, as envoy to Washington, D.C. and Paris, and Cipriano Kalaw, the first vice-president and Treasurer of the Central Committee of Hong Kong.\nIn the field of education, Father Valerio Malabanan was foremost among Lipe\u00f1os who established schools. Others were Sebastian Virrey, Jacinto Silva, Candido Lantin and Gregorio Katigbak. In 1894, Brigido Morada established his own school at his house in Mataas na Lupa. Under Father Valerio Malabanan were such well-known figures as Apolinario Mabini, General Miguel Malvar and Sotero Laurel. Sebastian Virrey countered with such former students as the brothers Alfonso and Claro M. Recto; Fidel and Carmelo Reyes; Teodoro and Maximo Kalaw; Pacifico, Jose and Enrique Laygo; and Manuel Luz Roxas, Jose D. Dimayuga, Bernabe Africa, Pablo Borbon, Potenciano Malvar, Leoncio Aranda and Bishop Alfredo Obviar.. The later school, perhaps marked for permanence by the enthusiastic patronage of its high standard maintained through the years since its founding in 1922 until the present, is the Mabini Academy established by Dr. Jose Ma. Katigbak, Randall A. Rowley, Tarcila Malabanan-Katigbak and Emilia Malabanan.\nThe fact that Lipe\u00f1os, even up to the present, are very religious, may be attributed to the fact that Fr. Benito Baras, who was Parish Priest of Lipa for almost three decades (1865\u20131894), has considered Villa de Lipa as his very own and had shown great paternal love for the Lipe\u00f1os. He constructed the Parish Church (now Cathedral of the Archdiocese of Lipa) and a new and bigger cemetery with a beautiful chapel. Without aid from the State, he constructed the bridge at Sabang and the road that served as a national highway to Manila and Laguna. The Lipa Parish, established in 1716, became a diocesan center in 1910, included the provinces of Batangas, Laguna, Tayabas (Quezon), Marinduque and Mindoro, with Msgr. Jose Petrelli as the first bishop. On August 15, 1972, the diocese was raised to an eccelesiastical province composed of Batangas province and the dioceses of Lucena, Infanta and Calapan, with Msgr Alejandro Olalia as the first Archbishop.\nOn August 31, 1947, Lipa was inaugurated as a chartered City created under Republic Act No. 162 approved on June 20, 1947.\nLipa covers an area of at an elevation of above sea level. Lipa's fishing area is located at barangay Halang, in the west of the city; it is actually a portion of Taal Lake, which is connected to other municipalities (Cuenca, Mataasnakahoy and Balete).\nLipa is bounded by the town of Santo Tomas in the northeast, San Pablo of Laguna and San Antonio, Quezon in the east, the municipalities of Padre Garcia and Rosario in the southeast, the municipalities of Ibaan and San Jose in the southwest, the municipalities of Cuenca and Mataasnakahoy and Taal Lake in the west and the municipalities of Balete and Malvar in the northwest.\nThe city's location, in a valley between Mount Malarayat and Mount Makulot, makes it a low-risk area for natural disasters. These two mountains serve as a windbreak during typhoons. Mount Makulot, in the west, also served as shield during eruptions of the Taal Volcano.\nLipa is subdivided into 72 barangays; San Jose was formerly known as Patay. In 1955, the sitios of Duhatan, Tagbakin, Initan, Malabong and Halang (then part of the Pinagtungolan barrio) became an independent barrio.\nIn 1957, the sitios of Waniwani, Sayatin and Look were moved from the Balete barrio to the barrio of Look.\nThe barangays are:\n- Adya\n- Anilao\n- Anilao-Labac\n- Antipolo Del Norte\n- Antipolo Del Sur\n- Bagong Pook\n- Balintawak\n- Banaybanay\n- Bolbok\n- Bugtong na Pulo\n- Bulacnin\n- Bulaklakan\n- Calamias\n- Cumba\n- Dagatan\n- Duhatan\n- Halang\n- Inosluban\n- Kayumanggi\n- Labac\n- Latag\n- Lodlod\n- Luma\n- Mabini\n- Malagonlong\n- Malitlit\n- Marawoy\n- Mataas Na Lupa\n- Munting Pulo\n- Pagolingin Bata\n- Pagolingin East\n- Pagolingin West\n- Pangao\n- Pinagkawitan\n- Pinagtongulan\n- Plaridel\n- Poblacion Barangay 1\n- Poblacion Barangay 2\n- Poblacion Barangay 3\n- Poblacion Barangay 4\n- Poblacion Barangay 5\n- Poblacion Barangay 6\n- Poblacion Barangay 7\n- Poblacion Barangay 8\n- Poblacion Barangay 9\n- Poblacion Barangay 9-A\n- Poblacion Barangay 10\n- Poblacion Barangay 11\n- Poblacion Barangay 12\n- Pusil\n- Quezon\n- Rizal\n- Sabang\n- Sampaguita\n- San Benito\n- San Carlos\n- San Celestino\n- San Francisco\n- San Guillermo\n- San Isidro (formerly Sapac)\n- San Jose\n- San Lucas\n- San Salvador\n- San Sebastian (Balagbag)\n- Santo Ni\u00f1o\n- Santo Toribio\n- Sico\n- Talisay\n- Tambo\n- Tangob\n- Tangway\n- Tibig\n- Tipacan\nIts climate is generally warm, except during typhoons and in summer. The average yearly temperature is . The highest recorded temperature is , and the lowest recorded temperature is . Rainfall is sporadic during the year; it is dry from January to May, and wet from June to December.\nThe population of Lipa, Batangas, in the ? was people, with a density of .\nTagalog is the most widely spoken language in the city. A mere percent of the population can still speak basic Spanish. English is the medium of instruction in schools and is widely understood and spoken especially in the business community and for all official documents.\nMajority of the city's population are Roman Catholics, and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lipa today comprises the civil province of Batangas. Formed as the Diocese of Lipa on April 10, 1910, the archdiocese once covered other provinces such as Batangas, Laguna, Quezon, Marinduque and Mindoro, with Most Reverend Joseph Petrelli, D.D. as the first bishop. Currently, the archdiocese is divided into 6 vicariates, each headed by a vicar forane. There are 49 parishes in all, served by 143 priests (122 of which are diocesan), 13 religious brothers, and 197 religious sisters. There are also 23 existing Catholic schools, two high school seminaries, three college seminaries, and two pastoral centers.\nThe Church and Monastery of Lipa is the location of a 1940's apparition of the Virgin Mary which was seen by sister Teresing Castillo and numerous accounts of rose petal showers from the 1940's to the 1960's. Some of the rose petals, which had the silhouette of the Virgin Mary when flashed with light, have been preserved by the Diocese of Lipa and various townfolks who have witnessed the petal showers. An investigation conducted by researchers of the University of the Philippines proved that the figures on the petals were natural and not stamped by man-made means. A few years after the apparition of the Virgin Mary, the Vatican released a document stating that the apparition in Lipa was false. Despite this, the rose petal showers continued until the last apparition of Mary appeared, saying three things, of which the most important was to 'pray for China', which at the time was among the poorest regions in the world. Due to the decline of the Vatican regarding the apparition, the Diocese of Lipa ordered the destruction of Mary's statue in the church which depicted the apparition. However, the founding nuns of the church hid it instead. Decades afterwards in the 21st century, before the death of a founding nun, she wished for the statue of the apparition to be viewed by the public once more. Thousands of devotees went back to the church and since then, the statue has been n public view. During a certain event, the priest ordered a mass outside the church to bless the municipality of Lipa, where the apparition statue was brought outside as well. During that time, sun beatings from heaven, which was viewed by thousands of people during a mass outside the church, occurred. Devotees flocked Lipa afterwards, where cures for blindness and terminal sickness were cured through the usage of prayers with the preserved petals from the petal showers of 1940's to 1960's. In 2014, it was later found out that most of the bishops who signed in favor of declaring the apparitions of 1940's as a lie were forced to sign such documents. This sparked the current Lipa Church to gather as much evidence to back the existence and miracles of the apparitions.\nThere are other Christian groups such as various Protestant denominations including Evangelicals, Born Again, Iglesia Ni Cristo, Members Church of God International (MCGI), Kingdom of Jesus Christ, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-Day Adventist, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nSeveral citizens also profess other religions including Islam and Buddhism.\nLipa\u2019s proximity to the country\u2019s capital, Manila, having an approximate distance of 86 kilometers or an hour and half drive via the Southern Luzon Expressway enhances its strategic access to development trends. It is fast emerging as a key city in the province, becoming a major institutional/administrative center, medical center, commercial center, financial center, agro-industrial center and residential center.\nIt is identified as an ideal hub and center of the CALABARZON Agro-Industrial Region in the Regional Physical Framework Plan of Region IV-A. In the recent past, Lipa is being transformed from basically agricultural to a highly urbanizing area. A significant portion of the agricultural land area of the city has been converted to residential subdivisions, industrial area with the establishment of LIMA Technology Center utilizing lands in the city and Malvar Municipality. Recently, the influx of business process outsourcing (BPO) firms such as call centers have contributed much to the growth of the local economy. BPO sites are scattered throughout the city. It ranked 6th out of 10 in the Top 10 next wave cities of 2010 by the Commission of Information and Communication Technology (ICCT).\nLipa City is the home of LOMI. According to history, this is primarily due to the influence of early Chinese settlers. \nLomi is cooked using raw noodles, cassava mixed with water, beaten egg, salt and pepper, meat, liver and other ingredients that make it tasty. Eventually, there are countless of variations of Lomi these days. The lomi house is a very common place found in every barangay. However, there are a few recognized by the Lipenos, like Renfel, Kids Lomihouse, LBN, Beegees, Liam's to mention a few.\nGOTO is also a popular recipe. It is usually composed of internal organs of cows. This is a bowl of hot soup with beef, tripe, entrails, and blood, added with fish sauce and calamansi juice with chili.\nHowever, due to influx of culture from nearby provinces, Lipe\u00f1os also enjoy new recipes like Sisig of Pampanga, and Bicol Express of Bicol. \nDue to Lipa's craze for food, several food courts have been established. You can find Dayton Food Court, Metro South Zone, Bojok's, and several other fast food outlets.\nLipa has few technologically advanced infrastructure. PKI is one of the advanced factories that pioneered the productions in Lipa City. Since it was established in Brgy. Inosluban, Lipa City was known to be an employment-friendly zone. This was followed by the establishment of LIMA TECHNOLOGY, which houses multiple production lines. It houses various companies that employ hundreds of production workers. Not only from the city proper, it hires employees from its nearby cities like Tanauan, Rosario, Batangas, San Jose, Malvar etc.\nMuseo de Lipa, inaugurated in November 2007, is the brainchild project of the Lipa City Tourism Council envisioned by its Past President, Lucila R. Resurreccion. It provides a chance for the people of Lipa to have a historical journey back to the city\u2019s past. On display are antique mementos such as: the Coffee Corner \u2013 an exhibit of the different tools used in coffee production; Las trajes de mestizas and ternos \u2013 gowns worn by women during the pre-war days and during festive occasions; the Satsuma Vase \u2013 a gift given by the Luna brothers to the unparalleled hospitality shown by the aristocratic couple Do\u00f1a Germana Solis and Dr. Jose Lozada; and the office tables of Don Claro Mayo Recto and Mayor Carlos Solis, the 24-hour Mayor.\nOther artifacts exhibited are certain collections of furniture and objects of art loaned and donated by different antique collectors and by some of the famous and landed gentry of Lipa: antique cabinets, tables, mirrors, antique silverware chinaware, tea sets, religious images and articles, jars, and brass artifacts.\nThe ground floor serves as a function area and currently features works of several contemporary Lipe\u00f1o visual artists.\nIn 1605, Don Diego de Salcedo discovered a community of farmers living in fairly good economic conditions at Lake Bombon, now Tagbakin, Lipa City. The Augustinians among them started a religious mission called \u201cConvent of San Sebastian in Comintang\u201d.\nHowever, the residents noticed that the land area- residential and agricultural-was getting smaller due to the rising waters of Taal Lake, they transferred to Balete. But the site was submerged by the lake in 1754 after the eruption of Taal Volcano. To avoid a similar occurrence, the townsfolk decided to transfer the town to a place far from the lake and the volcano. Legend has it that they agreed to pray the rosary while walking and whenever they may be at the end of the 24th mystery, there the town would be relocated. And they walked upland, away from the lake and the volcano, and at the end of the 24th mystery, they reached what is now called Mataas na Lupa. The temporary poblacion and the church were thus resettled there.\nThe location benefited everybody since it was along the main road that led to the coastal towns, the ground was high enough and the east winds were hedged in by high mountains. But after some time, the settlers had to seek another location due to the problem of water supple. The \u201cbetter site\u201d is the present site of the Cathedral. The Augustinians administered the parish until the end of the 19th century.\nThe first church building was made of light materials. The building of \u201cserious architecture, proven solidity and great proportions\u201d was begun in 1779 and finally completed in 1865, on the first year of Fr. Benito Varas who administered the town until 1894.\nThe church was made of hewn stone and tiled roof, in accordance with the usual pattern of churches. It was a rectangular structure with artistically painted wooden panelings in lieu of an arch to which were attached support and strong beams which crisscrossed the walls to protect the building from earthquakes, attractive and hade plain and simple altar ornaments without the extravagant carvings that were characteristic of the past century.\nDuring the 19th century, keen competition among Tanauan, Lipa, Batangas, Bauan and Taal for the choice of the seat of new diocese in the Southern Tagalog Region, with Batangas Province at the center, motivated the people to build extraordinary big churches. On April 10, 1910, the historic creation of the new diocese took place and the first bishop, Most Rev. Joseph Petrelli, D.D. selected LIPA as the See because of its cool climate. In later years, there were moves to transfer the See to San Pablo City but the late Bishop Alfredo Verzosa turned it down due to poor religious environment of San Pablo during that time.\nThe church suffered heavily in 1944. Msgr. Alejandro Olalia repaired the fa\u00e7ade, the dome, the transept, the roof, the main altar, and the belfry. The interior painting was retouched. Two side aisles were added. The church was awarded the title CATHEDRAL of the Archdiocese incorporating Batangas Province during the administration of the late Rufino Cardinal Santos.\nFr. Pedro G. Galende, OSA wrote that \u201cthe emphasis (of the edifice)is placed on the mass, which appeals much more to the senses due to its harmonic organization. The three buildings \u2013 church, convent and bell tower are so closely associated with each other that they well exemplify the typical mission complex.\u201d\nAt present, the 220-year old Cathedral and convent is undergoing massive restoration and repairs as an appropriate tibute to the Lord Jesus Christ on His 2000th birthday. Through the concerted efforts of the Parish Priest, Msgr. Alfredo A. Madlangbayan, and the San Sebastian Millenium Restoration Committee, the church fa\u00e7ade and the belfry have been beautifully repainted, the pews are newly varnished, the ceiling and the roof of the dome have been repaired, the old and leaking roof of the church and convent are replaced with long span GI sheets, and there is a new altar at the vigil room. On account of the multitude of faithful gathering at the church during liturgical activities, especially for Archdiocesan affairs, the sound system was also upgraded.\nIn the previous years, Lipa City had the Coffee Festival as its official city festival being coffee granary of the Philippines. The Coffee Festival was then celebrated from December 11 to 16.\nThen Lipa also had the Walistik Festival celebrated on the second week of January where walis (broom) was used in costumes and props. Walis symbolizes unity and this was what the Lipe\u00f1os had in mind everytime they celebrate Walistik Festival.\nNow, Lipa City is celebrating Lomi Festival. Lomi, being one of the most popular dishes in this side of the province, Lipa City has quite a number of lomi houses which never cease to entice people.\nLipa has an extensive road network. The city is a transportation hub for Batangas and nearby provinces.\nLipa is served by a network of national highways and an expressway. The Southern Tagalog Arterial Road (STAR Tollway) connects the city with Batangas City, Tanauan and Santo Tomas, with a connection to South Luzon Expressway (SLEX), thereby linking the city with Calamba and Metro Manila. Jose P. Laurel Highway, or Ayala Highway (Route 4) on one portion, connects Lipa with the municipalities and cities of Malvar, Tanauan, Santo Tomas, and Calamba in the north and San Jose and Batangas City to the south.

Leviste Highway or Lipa-Balete Road links Lipa with Balete.\nClaro M. Recto Avenue, General Luna Avenue, and B. Morada Avenue serve the city center or poblacion. On the rural areas within the city boundary, arterial roads, like Lodlod Avenue, Santo Tomas-Lipa Road and Lipa-Ibaan Road, serve the barangays and also connect with nearby municipalities, like Ibaan, and San Jose, and Santo Tomas. An arterial road running beside Fernando Air Base serves the municipality of Mataasnakahoy.\nBuses, vans, jeepneys, tricycles, and multicabs common means of transportation in the city. Large numbers of jeepneys ply their trade around the city, and are becoming the primary mode of transportation. A grand terminal built beside SM City Lipa mall now serves as the city's central transport terminal.\nLike other cities in the Philippines, Lipa is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head who leads the city's departments in the execution of city ordinances and in the delivery of public services. The vice mayor heads a legislative council that is composed of 13 members: twelve elected councilors and one ex officio office held by the Association of Barangay Chairmen President as the barangay sector representative.

He was first elected as mayor of Lipa in 2010 defeating incumbent mayor and former congressman Oscar Gozos, despite disqualification due to his residency. Sabili was formerly a resident of San Juan, Batangas, prior to being elected as mayor.\nThe city's vice mayor performs duties as acting governor in the absence of the mayor. He or she also automatically succeeds as mayor upon the death of the incumbent. He or she also convenes the Sangguniang Panlungsod, the city's legislative body. The incumbent vice mayor of Lipa is Eric Africa from the Liberal Party. He first assumed office on 30 June 2013. He ran and was elected for a second term in 2016.\nThe city, which is a lone congressional district, is represented in the Philippine House of Representatives by congresswoman Vilma Santos-Recto from the Liberal Party. She first assumed office as city mayor from 1998 to 2007 where she became the first female chief executive. After finishing her term, she was elected as the first female Governor of Batangas from 2007 to 2016.

Armed with two shotguns and a twenty-two-caliber rifle, they confronted the drivers of the wagons near what is now the corner of San Pablo Avenue and Buchanan Street. The women told the drivers of the horse-drawn garbage wagons to go home, which they did quickly and without complaint. Shortly thereafter, the residents of the town voted to incorporate as the City of Ocean View. In 1909, voters changed the name of the city, primarily to distinguish the city from the adjacent section of Berkeley which had previously been named Ocean View. On a vote of 38 to 6 the city was renamed in honor of Albany, New York, the birthplace of the city's first mayor, Frank Roberts.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (67.28%) is water.\nThe principal shopping street in Albany is Solano Avenue, which cuts across the city from west to east.

Shimla is also a district which is bounded by Mandi and Kullu in the north, Kinnaur in the east, the state of Uttarakhand in the south-east, and Solan and Sirmaur. In 1864, Shimla was declared as the summer capital of British India, succeeding Murree, northeast of Rawalpindi. After independence, the city became the capital of Punjab and was later named the capital of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the hilly regions of the state.\nSmall hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla. Its name is derived from the goddess Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Kali. \nShimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the Viceroy Lodge, the Christ Church, the Jakhoo Temple, the Mall Road and the Ridge, which together form the city centre. The Kalka\u2013Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions.\n", "text": "The vast majority of the area occupied by the present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation consisted of the Jakhoo temple and a few scattered houses. The area was called 'Shimla', named after a Hindu goddess, Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of Kali.\nThe area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal in 1806. The British East India Company took control of the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814\u201316). The Gurkha leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of David Ochterlony in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as \"a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers\". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the Hill States, set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the Scottish civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first pucca house in the area in 1822, near what is now the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General of Bengal, visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, Lord Combermere, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near Jakhu. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of Keonthal and Patiala in exchange for the Rawin pargana and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.\nIn 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting: between the Governor-General William Bentinck and the emissaries of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:\nCombermere's successor Earl Dalhousie visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from Sood and Parsi communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the Christ Church was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet road with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851\u201352. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851\u201352. The 1857 uprising caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.\nIn 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla. He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach. Lord Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876\u20131880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the \"Upper Bazaar\" nowadays known as the Ridge), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration.\nDuring the \"Hot Weather\", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, the head of the Indian Army, and many Departments of the Government. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen, \"was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust.\" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for \"frivolity, gossip and intrigue\". (See also.)\nThe Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about in length, was also built in 1905.\nThe Kalka\u2013Shimla railway line, opened in 1903, added to Shimla's accessibility and popularity. The railway route from Kalka to Shimla, with more than 806 bridges and 103 tunnels, was touted as an engineering feat and came to be known as the \"British Jewel of the Orient\". In 2008, it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mountain railways of India. In addition, Shimla was the capital of the undivided state of Punjab in 1871, and remained so until the construction of the new city of Chandigarh (the present-day capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana). Upon the formation of the state of Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Shimla was named its capital.\nAfter independence the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudatory princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalaya, known in full as the Shimla Hills States & four Punjab southern hill states by issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 & 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged in the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956. Following area of Punjab State namely Shimla, Kangra, Kulu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Nalagarh tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una kanungo circles, some area of Santokhgarh kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Tehsil of Pathankot District; were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union.\nPre-independence structures still dot Shimla; buildings such as the former Viceregal Lodge, Auckland House, Christ Church, Gorton Castle, Shimla Town Hall and the Gaiety Theatre are reminders of British rule in India. The original Peterhoff, another Viceregal residence, burned down in 1981. British Shimla extended about a mile and a half along the ridge between Jakhoo Hill and Prospect Hill. The central spine was the Mall, which ran along the length of the ridge, with a Mall Extension southwards, closed to all carriages except those of the Viceroy and his wife.\nShimla lies in the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at . It has an average altitude of above mean sea level and extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly from east to west. Shimla was built on top of a total of seven different hills namely: Inverarm Hill, Observatory Hill, Prospect Hill, Summer Hill, Bantony Hill, Elysium Hill and Jakhoo Hill. The highest point in Shimla is the Jakhoo hill, which is at a height of .\nThe city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region. There are no water bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about away. Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna).\nThe green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over . The main forests in and around the city are of pine, deodar, oak and rhododendron. Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot. Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place after heavy rains.\nThe city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital.

Monthly precipitation varies between in November and in August. It is typically around per month during winter and spring, and around in June as the monsoon approaches.\nThe average total annual precipitation is , which is much less than most other hill stations but still much heavier than on the plains. Snowfall in the region, which historically has taken place in the month of December, has lately (over the last fifteen years) been happening in January or early February every year.\nThe maximum snowfall received in recent times was on 18 January 2013. On two consecutive days (17 and 18 January 2013), the town received of snow.\nEmployment is largely driven by the government and tourism sectors.

Shimla leads the list of Indian cities with the highest ranked hotels.\nShimla had always been famous for its quality of education and many important schools have been imparting quality education throughout the state. Along with schools of higher education, several institutes are also present, namely Himachal Pradesh University and Indian Institute of Advanced Study. Recruitment to the IAAS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Civil Services Examination) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to IAAS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts, Shimla. Students from across India prefer to study in Shimla because of its climate and Queen of Hill Stations status. These have added to the economy of the district as well as the state.\nGovernment is trying to promote technology and IT sector as the new area for growth and promotion although not many companies have yet settled in Shimla.

Two notable companies that are registered in Shimla are Netgen IT Solutions, an international website development startup with partner offices in USA and Australia, and Himachal Media, a company that deals with content and media publishing.\nThe administrative responsibilities of the city of Shimla and merged areas of Dhalli, Totu and New Shimla reside with the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC). All three areas were taken under SMC in 2006\u201307. Established in 1851, the Shimla Municipal Corporation is an elected body comprising 27 councillors, three of whom are nominated by the Government of Himachal Pradesh. The nominations are based on prominence in the fields of social service, academics and other activities. Thirty-three percent of the seats are reserved for women.

As per the 2001 India Census, the city has a population of 142,161 spread over an area of 19.55 km\u00b2. A floating population of 75,000 is attributed to service industries such as tourism. The largest demographic, 55%, is 16\u201345 years of age. A further 28% of the population are younger than 15 years. The low sex ratio \u2013 930 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2001 \u2013 is cause for concern, and much lower than the 974 versus 1,000 for Himachal Pradesh state as a whole.\nThe unemployment rate in the city has come down from 36% in 1992 to 22.6% in 2006.

In 1907 L. A. G. Shoaff bought the Centralia White Stockings and renamed them the Paris Colts. In 1908 the team was renamed the Paris Parisians. After the 1908 season the team went under. Paris was the home of a minor league baseball team in the 1950s named the Paris Lakers. A contest was held among the community to decide on a name for the team. The winning submission, Paris Lakers, was sent in by James C. Dickey. The Paris Lakers were the 1956 Midwest League Champions and were an affiliate of the Chicago Cubs.\nParis is located at (39.613014, -87.693829).\nU.S. Route 150 and Illinois State Route 1 pass through Paris. Both Illinois State Route 16 and Illinois State Route 133 have Illinois State Route 1 as their eastern terminus. One railroad passes through town, a CSX Transportation line that goes north toward Danville and southeast toward Terre Haute, Indiana.\nAccording to the 2010 census, Paris has a total area of , of which (or 93.39%) is land and (or 6.61%) is water.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 9,077 people, 3,874 households, and 2,382 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,885.3 people per square mile (728.6/km\u00b2). There were 4,211 housing units at an average density of 874.6 per square mile (338.0/km\u00b2).

About 8.9% of families and 12.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 17.2% of those under age 18 and 11.2% of those age 65 or over.\nParis is composed of two public school districts: Paris Union School District 95 (for those living inside city limits) and Paris Community Unit School District No. 4 (for those outside the city limits). Those who are in District 95 send their children to Mayo Middle School, while Unit 4 children attend Crestwood School. However, both schools feed into one high school. Paris High School is the only secondary education facility in Paris and prior to July 1, 2009 was under District 95. On July 1, 2009, the renamed Paris Cooperative High School became the first cooperative high school in the state of Illinois.\nThe high school celebrated its 100-year anniversary in 2009.\nParis Cooperative High School's mascot is the tiger and its colors are orange and black.\nParis is also the home of Saint Mary's School. It is a Catholic school serving grades preschool through 8th grade and is open to children of all religions. St. Mary's is the only tuition-based private school in Paris.\nParis Community Fire Protection District - PCFPD\nThis district contains 5 stations. 1 being Paris which is a full-time paid department and the others being Vermilion, Oliver, Grandview, and Redmon which are all volunteer department\nClimate is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year.

It is part of the Ogden-Clearfield Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 15,335 at the 2010 census. It is located adjacent to the easternmost part of the Great Salt Lake.\n", "text": "According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 6.0 square miles (15.6 km\u00b2), all of it land.\nThis climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification system, Centerville has a humid continental climate, abbreviated \"Dfb\" on climate maps.\nCenterville was first settled by Thomas Grover in the fall of 1847. The community was originally known as Deuel Settlement, but was renamed to Cherry Creek after the Cherry family arrived. After an 1850 survey found the town was located precisely between Farmington and Bountiful, it became known as Centerville, and it was this name that stuck.\n- In 1849, Shadrach Roundy's family farmed in the general vicinity of Centerville, and in the winter of 1849 he built a grist mill on Deuel Creek. He also made molasses from corn stalks at this mill.\n- In 1851 a log school house was built in Centerville, but was replaced by an adobe building in 1854 by a much larger building in 1862.\n- Centerville was the home of Latter-day Saint church leader B. H. Roberts.\n- In 1869, the Utah Central Rail Road reached Centerville.\n- In December 2011 a severe wind storm caused power outages and over $8 million damage.\nThe first branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Centerville was organized in 1850 with Sanford Porter as president. In 1852, Centerville was made a ward with Sanford Porter as bishop. In 1868, an LDS Sunday School was organized with Nathan Tanner Porter as president. In 1869, a Relief Society was organized with Mary Ann Harmon as president. In 1874, a branch of the United Order was organized in Centerville with William R. Smith as president. In December 1917, the Centerville Ward was divided into the Centerville 1st and Centerville 2nd Wards. In 1930, the two Centerville Wards had a combined membership of 823.\nToday, there are four stakes of the LDS Church in Centerville.\nThe Episcopal Church of the Resurrection (ECOR) also resides in Centerville on 1131 S. Main Street. Originally organized in 1963 as a mission of the Cathedral Church of St. Mark to serve the Episcopalians in the southern part of Davis County, Utah, ECOR\u2019s first services were held in the Bountiful Jeep Posse Clubhouse. Parish records indicate that there were approximately 50 members at that time.\nAround 1967, the Very Reverend Wesley Frensdorff, Dean of St. Mark\u2019s, and the Reverend Donald Mills facilitated the use of the Bountiful Community Church (BCC) for worship. As a result, ECOR began using the small Danforth Chapel at BCC for the next 25 years. The two congregations shared facilities, budget, committees, programs, church school, and one service each month. Problems, however, developed between the congregations and in 1993, ECOR separated from Bountiful Community Church to locate in an empty bank building in Centerville.\nIn 2000, Project Jubilee\u2014an expansion effort funded by the Episcopal Diocese of Utah\u2014purchased land for a new church building just south of the bank. Ground breaking for the new church took place in March 2001. The first service was held on Easter, 2002 and Bishop Carolyn Tanner Irish dedicated the building on May 18, 2002. Today, the church hosts Sunday service with Holy Eucharist weekly at 10:00 AM. The Reverend Lyn Zill Briggs currently presides as rector and priest of the congregation.\nThe Centerville City Youth Council is a service & political based organization, sponsored and funded by Centerville City. It is the sponsor of many youth activities including the annual Halloween Pumpkin Walk, Christmas Coloring Contest, Easter Egg Hunt, and recently, a Teen Movie Night. Politically, the youth council's objective is to represent the youth of Centerville City with the Youth Mayor acting as the liaison to the City Council. Recently, the youth council has been in the planning and implementation process of a new recycling program now operating successfully throughout the city. \nThe Youth Council is currently set up with a Youth Mayor and Council between the ages of 14 and 18. Each member serves a term of 2 years that can be renewed.

The highway was established in 1965 as a connector from I-15 to SR-106 in Centerville. It remained essentially unchanged until it was extended westward to connect to the newly constructed Legacy Parkway in 2008.\nIn 2017 the highway thoroughfare, Parrish lane section, is home to the commercial district of Centerville, UT. Major businesses include WalMart, Target, Home Depot, PetSmart, Kohls and several smaller retail businesses. Restaurants include the California burger chain In-N-Out. ChickFilA, McDonald's, Wendys, Arbys and several other fast food offerings. In addition, several small independent professional business line the street. Parrish Lane connects with Centerville's main street where several other business operate including dentists, physicians, chiropractors and other white coat/white collar businesses reside. \nIn addition, several professional businesses including real estate, insurance and service based businesses can be found. \nCenterville maintains five public schools in the city. The nearest high school is Viewmont High School, located south of Centerville in the city of Bountiful.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 120, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 120, "length": 298, "sectionHeading": "Geography | Climate", "sectionLabel": "city.climate"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 418, "length": 905, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1323, "length": 2151, "sectionHeading": "History | Ecclesiastical history", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3474, "length": 826, "sectionHeading": "Centerville City Youth Council", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4300, "length": 1619, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5919, "length": 1056, "sectionHeading": "Business", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6975, "length": 159, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getafe", "type": "city", "title": "Getafe", "abstract": "Getafe (] ) is a city in the south of the Madrid metropolitan area, Spain, and one of the most populated and industrialised cities in the area. It is home to one of the oldest Spanish military air bases and the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. Within the city is the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles, or Hill of the Angels, a site considered the geographical center of the Iberian Peninsula. Getafe is located 13 km south of Madrid's city centre, within a flat area of Spain's Meseta Central in the Manzanares River basin.\nGetafe's proximity to Madrid fostered industrial development during the 20th and 21st centuries. The city's industrialisation led to an increase in population, reaching 170,115 in 2011. Due to its industrial and social networks, the majority of residents work or study within the city. The increase in population led to the construction of numerous access roads, an increase in available public services, and the creation of new neighborhoods at the end of the 20th century.\n", "text": "During the Middle Ages, a number of villages were located in the present-day area of Getafe. One of the main villages was Alarnes, which was very close to the current urban center. In 1326, the villagers united themselves into one town, situated on the royal road that linked Madrid with Toledo. This new town was called Xatafi, a name which came from the Arab word jata (\"something long\"). It is assumed that the name Xatafi referred to the royal road, which also served as the town's main street. The town's name evolved over time, from Xetafe to Jetafee to Jetaphe to Jetafe to Getafe.\nThe history of Getafe can be split into three clearly defined eras. In the first era, which lasted from Prehistory until 1326, there existed distinct villages in the area, though Getafe itself did not exist as a municipality. The second era lasted from the 14th century until the 20th century, during which Getafe was established as a town and developed slowly. In the third era, which began in the 20th century and continues to the present day, Getafe changed in nature from a small agricultural town to a large industrial city, with a noticeable increase in commerce, industry, population and size.\nThe presence of humans in the area of Getafe dates back to the Lower Paleolithic period (before 100,000 BCE). Various stone tools, pots, and bracelets from this period have been excavated from the banks of the Manzanares River.\nThe Romans dominarse the Iberian Peninsula from the 2nd century BCE until the 5th century AD. In the 3rd century AD, the Romans constructed a villa called La Torecilla, whose ruins are still visible on the banks of the Manzanares River. The area was subsequently overrun by a series of Germanic tribes, including Suebi, Vandals and Visigoths, and the Indoeuropean Alans.\nThe area currently encompassed by the Getafe municipal district was invaded by the Moors in the 8th century. King Alfonso VI conquered the villages of the area in 1085. In 1326, the inhabitants of the villages moved closer to the royal road connecting Madrid and Toledo, in effect creating a new town, Getafe. In that same century, the primitive hermitage of La Magdalena was built, only to be destroyed several centuries later.\nIn 1492, famine and disease devastated Getafe, prompting the construction of the Hospitalillo de San Jos\u00e9 in 1529. In 1549, the architect Alonso de Covarrubias began building the Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Magdalena, which has since become the Cathedral of the Diocese of Getafe. The church was built on the foundation of the old hermitage, and in 1610 a new hermitage was built on the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles. The college of the Escuelas P\u00edas was founded in 1737. In 1763, King Charles III ordered the construction of a new road connecting Madrid to Aranjuez and, further on, to C\u00e1diz, which passed along the foot of the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles. Napoleonic troops occupied Getafe from 1808 to 1812. A train line connecting Madrid to Aranjuez, and passing through Getafe, was inaugurated in 1851.\nElectric street lights were lit for the first time in Getafe on 22 December 1897. The Getafe Air Force Base was permanently established in 1911, followed by the School of Civil Aviation two years later. King Alfonso XIII inaugurated the first monument to the Sacred Heart of Jesus on the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles on 30 May 1919. In 1924, Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas S.A. built its first factory in the area. That same year, Juan de la Cierva's autogyro was flown for the first time from the air force base.\nDue to its proximity to Madrid, Getafe underwent an industrial revolution at the beginning of the 20th century, resulting in the city's conversion from agricultural city to industrial city. Industrialization also prompted a rapid boom in population, starting in the 1950s. In 1956, John Deere established a factory in Getafe, and a year later, Siemens AG followed suit. The city was forced to create the neighborhoods of San Isidro, El Bercial, Juan de la Cierva, and Las Margaritas in the 1970s in order to support these new industries.\nIn 1961, the Canal de Isabel II began to provide water to Getafe. The first local democratic elections occurred in 1979, after the ratification of the Constitution in 1978. In 1989, the Universidad Carlos III was founded. The Sector III neighbourhood was constructed between 1979 and 1988; the Getafe Norte neighbourhood was built during the late 1990s; the El Bercial neighbourhood is currently being expanded. In April 2003, Madrid Metro System's Line 12 opened, linking the Madrid region's southern population centres with the capital.\nThe coat of arms of Getafe is divided vertically into two equal halves that represent the two most important characteristics of the municipal district. The left half contains a heart in the center of a Latin cross, representing the Sacred Heart of Jesus\u2014a reference to the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles. The right half contains a repeated pattern of airplanes representing the aeronautical tradition of the area and referencing the nearby Air Force Base. The Royal Spanish Crown tops the coat of arms, and symbolizes Getafe's loyalty to the Spanish monarchy.\nThe current mayor of Getafe is Sara Hern\u00e1ndez Barroso, socialist, thanks to the support of left wing group United Left (IU) and a political platform close to Podemos called 'Ahora Getafe'. In 2011, Juan Soler-Espiauba Gallo, of the People's Party (PP), removed of the power a well-known mayor, socialist, who had held this post since 1983. The most popular political parties in the area, other than the PSOE, are the Peoples' Party (PP) and the United Left (IU). Getafe has always had a large working population, and left-wing groups, especially the PSOE, have traditionally been very influential.\nIn the 2007 Spanish regional elections, the PSOE elected 13 town councillors (44.18% of the vote), PP, 11 (36.09%), and IU 3, (11.73%). Other political associations were not able to muster enough votes to receive representation. Local elections occur every four years, along with the autonomous election. \nIn the last Spanish General elections celebrated in 2015, PP obtained 25,65% of the vote, very close to Podemos (24,72%) and PSOE (22,60%). Ciudadanos obtained 16,54% of the vote and IU 7,07%.\nCabinet meetings are composed of nine councillors: eight from the PSOE and one from IU. The Municipal Corporation is made up of 27 members, detailed previously. The cabinet is presided over by the mayor. The Getafe city council is divided into a number of different focus groups: treasury, wealth, and social security; equality; urbanism; civil action; and management of waste disposal, cleanliness, the environment, and the home. The council holds sessions every month, in addition to frequently held special sessions, in which councillors debate various topics and problems which affect the municipality.\nGetafe is at the forefront of the struggle for workers rights in local industry. The most important trade unions in the city are the Workers' Commissions (CCOO) and the Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores (UGT). Both unions have branch offices in Getafe and list many local workers as members.\nGetafe is located in the southern zone of the autonomous community of Madrid, Spain, in southwestern Europe. It is physically located in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula, north of the Southern Submeseta (part of the Meseta Central), in the Manzanares River basin. Its elevation is 610 \u2013 640 meters above sea level (2000\u20132100 feet). Its coordinates are 40\u00b0 18' N 3\u00b0 43' W. The municipal district is 78.74 km, with a perimeter of 46.5 km. The easternmost part of the municipal district is located within the Parque Regional del Sureste, a protected forest region.\nDue to its central location within the Iberian Peninsula, Getafe is no more than 725.6 km from any Spanish provincial capital in mainland Spain. The following are the distances to a few major cities, the oceans which surround the Spanish coasts, and the national borders of Portugal and France.\nThe municipal district is mostly flat, with a minor inclination of 5% to the east and an elevation of 631 m (2070 ft) above sea level. The lowest altitude can be found to the extreme east, at the Manzanares River at 540 m (1772 ft). The highest elevation is found on the extreme west, on Buenavista, a 704 m (2310 ft) hill which sits on the border between the municipalities of Getafe and Legan\u00e9s, some 12 km South of Madrid. The hilliest area, the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa, is located in the Southeast and has a maximum elevation of 698 m (2290 ft). In the center of Getafe is the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles, or hill of angels (670 m; 2198 ft). Pine forests have been planted at the feet of these hills to deter the erosion of the soil.\nA number of rivers and other natural waterways pass through Getafe. 9.5 km of the Manzanares River passes through the eastern-most parts of the municipal district. In the South, 16.5 km of the Culebro Waterway winds its way across Getafe, and in the Southeast 2 km of the Filipinas gully descent from the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa. There are two man-made canals, one on each side of the Manzanares River. These parallel canals provide water for cultivated land further from the river.\nThe lakes of Perals are 2 km East of the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles, and are some of the only undisturbed natural lakes left in the region. For this reason, the lakes are part of a protected area to preserve their natural state.\nThe Culebra waterway and the Filipinas gully boast heavy water flow during the winter and little to none during the summer. In contrast, the Manzanares carries water year round. For that reason, Getafe is considered to be within the Manzanares river basin, except for a small portion in the southeast which is part of the Jarama river basin.\nThe city of Getafe borders the following municipalities: to the North, Madrid (city districts Villaverde and Vallecas; to the East, Rivas Vaciamadrid; to the Southeast, San Mart\u00edn de la Vega; to the South, Pinto; to the Southwest, Fuenlabrada; to the West, Legan\u00e9s.\nThe climate of Getafe is Mediterranean and is influenced by urban conditions. Winters are cool, with temperatures dropping below 10 \u00b0C (46.4 \u00b0F) during the day, and frequently below 2 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) at night. Getafe averages three to four snowfalls per year. Summers are very hot, with median temperatures above 25 \u00b0C (75.2 \u00b0F) in July and August, and with maximum temperatures which often reach 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). Daily temperatures oscillate within range of 10 \u00b0C (18 \u00b0F).\nPrecipitations are regularly distributed throughout the year, excluding the dry summer months. The rainiest month is October, with 50 mm of rainfall, and the driest month is July, with only 9.4 mm . Average yearly precipitation is around 365 mm (17.52 in).\nOne of the major problems of Getafe's climate is air pollution, which increases noticeably when the wind blows South or Southeast. The average annual temperature is 15 \u00b0C, with the highest temperature on record listed at 41.6 \u00b0C (106.8 \u00b0F) on 24 July 1995, and the lowest temperature recorded at -12 \u00b0C (10.4 \u00b0F) on 5 February 1963. The average relative humidity is 71%, average pressure is 1,015.8 millibars, average number of daylight hours per year is 2,850, and the winds blow predominantly from the northeast.\nExtreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and tornadoes, never occur in Getafe thanks to its climate and geography. One common problem in the interior of the Iberian Peninsula is drought, which occurs whenever precipitation ceases during various months.\nThe native vegetation of Getafe is characteristic of the mediterranean forest biome, consisting mostly of holm and cork oaks. Native flowering plants include those of the genus Cistus and the common broom (Cytisus scoparius), though these species are not abundant. This native forest and underbrush only occupies 16% of the surface of the municipal territory, mostly in the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa and further east. The shores of the Manzanares River and Culebro Waterway contain deciduous trees and reeds.\nMost undeveloped land is devoted to the cultivation of cereals (mostly wheat), and, to a lesser extent, to gardens in the fertile lowlands of the Manzanares river. Some areas have been reforested with stone pines (Pinus pinea) and aleppo pines (Pinus halepensis). These areas include the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles, the Prado Acedinos, part of the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa, and part of the park in the Sector III neighborhood. Common trees in the parks and streets of the city are the horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum), the acacia, the elm (Ulmus minor), and the stone pine. Other less common trees include cedars, cypress, aleppo pines, plum trees, poplars, fir trees, and palm trees.\nA significant population of small birds live within the city proper, including sparrows and pigeons. Larger birds, rabbits, foxes, wild boars, and weasels can be found in the more easterly parts of the municipality. The world's largest population of the common kestrel can be found in the Perales del R\u00edo neighborhood.\nThe urban portions of Getafe are organised in an almost longitudinal manner, from northeast to southwest. Thus, the elongated shape of Getafe today is due primarily to the close proximity of the Getafe Air Force Base, which impedes city growth to the southeast. The most important streets of the city are Calle Madrid and Calle Toledo. These two roads are pedestrian through the center of Getafe, and are part of what was a royal road connecting Madrid and Toledo during the Middle Ages. Getafe has other important streets and avenues organizing its neighborhoods, such as the Avenida de Espa\u00f1a, Avenida de Los \u00c1ngeles, Avenida de las Ciudades, Avenida Juan Carlos I, and Calle Ferrocarril.\nThe popular architectural style in Getafe is generally characterised by two-story buildings with tile roofs, various small balconies on the second floor, and a bare brick fa\u00e7ade. These types of houses can be found in the Getafe Centro neighbourhood, though their numbers are decreasing as existing houses are vacated and demolished to make room for new townhouse developments. The average height of buildings in Getafe is five floors, approximately 60 feet (17 metres). This peculiarity is due to the proximity of the Getafe Air Force Base, which places limits on the height of buildings. Few buildings in Getafe surpass eight stories in height.\nDue to the developmental limitations imposed by the Air Force Base and the municipality borders, the city's parks and green spaces are important conservation areas. Two of the largest parks are located within the Sector III and La Alh\u00f3ndiga neighbourhoods. These green zones include an artificial lake and river, two pine forests, and a number of hiking trails. The parks cover an area approximately the size of Getafe Centro, and make up the western part of the urban centre, separated from the east by the A-42. A series of parks of various sizes are located within the city proper. Outside of the city are two pine forests with picnic areas, fountains, and kiosks.\nGetafe's urban centre is undergoing various expansions of its urban centre. One of these is the construction and establishment of the El Bercial neighbourhood. This expansion of El Bercial will quadruple the size of the neighbourhood and will allow the city to expand to the northeast, linking El Bercial to the urban centre. The Los Olivos industrial park is expanding eastward, while at the same time, the Perales del R\u00edo neighbourhood grows westward, bringing these two neighbourhoods closer together. The \u00c1rea Tecnol\u00f3gica del Sur is being constructed in the southern parts of the municipal district, along the M-50. The \u00c1rea will be an area dedicated to a number of exposition halls and areas for new industrial development.\nGetafe township has a number of projects underway to expand urban areas. One of these projects is expanding the Sector III neighborhood by constructing housing at the feel of Buenavista hill. Another project involves creating a residential neighborhood called Los Molinos, located east of Getafe Norte and north of the Los \u00c1ngeles industrial park. A third project calls for the construction of a university, the Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Getafe, which will include three departments and a central building.\nPrior to the 20th century, Getafe had only one neighbourhood, which encompassed the modern Getafe Centro and La Alh\u00f3ndiga neighborhoods. The Perales del R\u00edo neighborhood is also one of the oldest neighbourhoods in the municipality, dating from approximately the 17th century. Since the 1960s, a population boom prompted the creation of new neighbourhoods, such as those of San Isidro, Juan de la Cierva, Las Margaritas, and El Bercial. In the 1980s, the Sector III neighbourhood was built and the Perales del R\u00edo was significantly expanded. During the following decade, the Getafe Norte neighbourhood was built.

Settlers arriving to mine the deposits founded the town of St. Joseph Iron Works in 1831. Within a few years, the town had a blast furnace, a general store, a tavern, and about 200 residents. Business prospered, and in 1833 St. Joseph Iron Works, Indiana City, and two other adjacent small towns were incorporated to form the city of Mishawaka.\nThe Mishawaka post office has been in operation since 1833.\nIn September 1872, a fire destroyed three quarters of Mishawaka\u2019s business district. However, the citizens rebuilt and attracted new industry. The Dodge Manufacturing Company, Perkins Windmills and the Mishawaka Woolen and Rubber Company (later Ball Band, then Uniroyal) all helped the town to prosper. Mishawaka grew through both industry and agriculture. In the late 19th century, Mishawaka became known as the \"Peppermint Capital of the World\", since the area's rich black loam produced great quantities of mint.\nFrom 1906 to 1915, Mishawaka was the manufacturing home of the luxurious American Simplex motor car. Four American Simplex autos entered the first Indianapolis 500 in 1911. One Simplex crashed, killing the mechanic riding with the driver, while the other Mishawaka cars finished sixth, eighth and twentieth.\nBall Band made rubber garments and was hit by a major strike in 1931. It flourished in the 1940s, finally closing in 1997 in the face of cheaper imports. Manufacturing in Mishawaka peaked in the 1940s and began a slow decline due to industrial restructuring. The economic base shifted to retail services and small industry.\nIn 1979, University Park Mall opened north of Mishawaka. In 1990, AM General began producing the Hummer in its Mishawaka plant. The MV-1 is a purpose-built taxicab and replaces the planned Standard Taxi; it was developed in collaboration with AM General. The car is built in Mishawaka at an AM General plant. AM General will begin making Mercedes vehicles at this plant in 2015.\nOld-fashioned neighborhoods are found across the city. Many of the newer residential subdivisions that have been developed within the city in recent years have adopted design guidelines to produce the \"hometown\" neighborhood feel and encourage community spirit. \nThe city continually upgrades and develops new neighborhood park and recreation facilities. A total of 29 parks allow Mishawaka residents to golf, play ball, fish and exercise. In 1968, the city opened an outdoor Olympic-size swimming pool and an adjacent ice skating rink at Merrifield Park. On the south side, Mishawaka's George Wilson Park is home to the city's most popular winter toboggan spot, as well as an 18-hole frisbee golf course. Some of the city's Italian immigrants and their descendants still play traditional games such as bocce, and a few ethnic Belgians continue to raise and race homing pigeons. The city also hosted the nation's oldest and largest wiffleball tournament, the World Wiffle Ball Championship, from 1980-2012. \nThe city's three high schools (Mishawaka High School, Penn High School, and Marian High School) have won a combined 11 state championships in football since 1920.\nAccording to the 2010 census, Mishawaka has a total area of , of which (or 97.99%) is land and (or 2.01%) is water.\nAs of 2000 the median income for a household in the city was $33,986, and the median income for a family was $41,947. Males had a median income of $33,878 versus $23,672 for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,434. About 7.3% of families and 9.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 11.7% of those under age 18 and 7.3% of those age 65 or over.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 48,252 people, 21,343 households, and 11,730 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 24,088 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 86.1% White, 6.9% African American, 0.4% Native American, 1.9% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 1.6% from other races, and 2.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.5% of the population.\nThere were 21,343 households of which 28.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 35.5% were married couples living together, 14.4% had a female householder with no husband present, 5.1% had a male householder with no wife present, and 45.0% were non-families. 37.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 12.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

Although Native Americans do not have royalties, in the 19th century, \"princess\" was a term often used to describe a tribal Chief's daughter. According to the story, the Shawnee were permitted to settle on Potawatomi lands in the late 18th century, and Potawatomi Chief Grey Wolf soon fell in love with Mishawaka. She rejected his advances and pledged her love to a white trapper, known only as Deadshot. A war between the two tribes ensued, and Grey Wolf captured Mishawaka and threatened to kill her unless she married him. Deadshot followed him, however, and the two men fought to the death. Grey Wolf died, but not before stabbing Mishawaka in the breast. She recovered, but died in 1818 at age 32. She was supposedly buried near Lincoln Park, where a bronze marker recounts the legend.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 2038, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2038, "length": 1171, "sectionHeading": "Neighborhoods, leisure and sports heritage", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3209, "length": 116, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3325, "length": 382, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3707, "length": 1199, "sectionHeading": "Demographics | 2010 census", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4906, "length": 407, "sectionHeading": "Transportation", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5313, "length": 553, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5866, "length": 1088, "sectionHeading": "Media", "sectionLabel": "city.media"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6954, "length": 883, "sectionHeading": "Legend of \"Princess\" Mishawaka", "sectionLabel": "city.other"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_City", "type": "city", "title": "Panama City", "abstract": "Panama City ( ; ] ) is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Panama. It has an urban population of 430,299, and its population totals 880,691 with 1,526,421 in its metropolitan area. The city is located at the Pacific entrance of the Panama Canal, in the province of Panama. The city is the political and administrative center of the country, as well as a hub for international banking and commerce. It is considered a \"Beta-\" world city, one of three Central American cities listed in this category.\nPanama's Tocumen International Airport, the largest and busiest airport in Central America, offers daily flights to major international destinations. Panama was chosen as the 2003 American Capital of Culture jointly with Curitiba, Brazil. It is among the top five places for retirement in the world, according to International Living Magazine.\nThe city of Panama was founded on August 15, 1519, by Spanish conquistador Pedro Arias D\u00e1vila. The city was the starting point for expeditions that conquered the Inca Empire in Peru. It was a stopover point on one of the most important trade routes in the history of the American continent, leading to the fairs of Nombre de Dios and Portobelo, through which passed most of the gold and silver that Spain took from the Americas.\nOn January 28, 1671, the original city (see Panam\u00e1 Viejo) was destroyed by a fire when privateer Henry Morgan sacked and set fire to it. The city was formally reestablished two years later on January 21, 1673, in a peninsula located from the original settlement. The site of the previously devastated city is still in ruins and is now a popular tourist attraction.\n", "text": "The city was founded on August 15, 1519, by Pedro Arias de \u00c1vila, also known as Pedrarias D\u00e1vila. Within a few years of its founding, the city became a launching point for the exploration and conquest of Peru and a transit point for gold and silver headed back to Spain through the Isthmus. In 1671 Henry Morgan with a band of 1400 men attacked and looted the city, which was subsequently destroyed by fire. The ruins of the old city still remain and are a popular tourist attraction known as Panam\u00e1 la Vieja (Old Panama). It was rebuilt in 1673 in a new location approximately southwest of the original city. This location is now known as the Casco Viejo (Old Quarter) of the city.\nOne year before the start of the California Gold Rush, the Panama Railroad Company was formed, but the railroad did not begin operation until 1855. Between 1848 and 1869, the year the first transcontinental railroad was completed in the United States, about 375,000 persons crossed the isthmus from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and 225,000 in the opposite direction. That traffic greatly increased the prosperity of the city during that period.\nThe construction of the Panama Canal was of great benefit to the infrastructure and economy. Of particular note are the improvements in health and sanitation brought about by the American presence in the Canal Zone. Dr. William Gorgas, the chief sanitary officer for the canal construction, had a particularly large impact. He hypothesized that diseases were spread by the abundance of mosquitos native to the area, and ordered the fumigation of homes and the cleansing of water. This led to yellow fever being eradicated by November 1905, as well malaria rates falling dramatically. However, most of the laborers for the construction of the canal were brought in from the Caribbean, which created unprecedented racial and social tensions in the city.\nDuring World War II, construction of military bases and the presence of larger numbers of U.S. military and civilian personnel brought about unprecedented levels of prosperity to the city. Panamanians had limited access, or no access at all, to many areas in the Canal Zone neighboring the Panama city metropolitan area. Some of these areas were military bases accessible only to United States personnel. Some tensions arose between the people of Panama and the U.S. citizens living in the Panama Canal Zone. This erupted in the January 9, 1964 events, known as Martyrs' Day.\nIn the late 1970s through the 1980s the city of Panama became an international banking center, bringing a lot of undesirable attention as an international money-laundering center. In 1989 after nearly a year of tension between the United States and Panama, President George H. W. Bush ordered the invasion of Panama to depose General Manuel Noriega, the country's de facto dictator. As a result, a portion of the El Chorrillo neighborhood, which consisted mostly of old wood-framed buildings dating back to the 1900s (though still a large slum area), was destroyed by fire. In 1999, the United States officially transferred control of the Panama Canal Zone to Panama, which remains in control today.\nThe city of Panama remains a banking center, although with very visible controls in the flow of cash. Shipping is handled through port facilities in the area of Balboa operated by the Hutchison Whampoa Company of Hong Kong and through several ports on the Caribbean side of the isthmus. Balboa, which is located within the greater Panama metropolitan area, was formerly part of the Panama Canal Zone, and in fact the administration of the former Panama Canal Zone was headquartered there.\nPanam\u00e1 is located between the Pacific Ocean and tropical rain forest in the northern part of Panama. The Parque Natural Metropolitano (Metropolitan Nature Park), stretching from Panama City along the Panama Canal, has unique bird species and other animals, such as tapir, puma, and caimans. At the Pacific entrance of the canal is the Centro de Exhibiciones Marinas (Marine Exhibitions Center), a research center for those interested in tropical marine life and ecology, managed by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.\nTropical forests around Panama are vital for the functioning of the Panama Canal, providing it with the water required for its operation. Due to the canal's importance to the Panamanian economy, tropical forests around the canal have been kept in an almost pristine state; the canal is thus a rare example of a vast engineering project in the middle of a forest that helped to preserve that forest. Along the western side of the canal is the Parque Nacional Soberan\u00eda (Sovereignty National Park), which includes the Summit botanical gardens and a zoo. The best known trail in this national park is Pipeline Road, popular among birdwatchers.\nNearly 500 rivers lace Panama's rugged landscape. Most are unnavigable; many originate as swift highland streams, meander in valleys, and form coastal deltas. However, the R\u00edo Chepo and the R\u00edo Chagres, both within the boundaries of the city, work as sources of hydroelectric power.\nThe R\u00edo Chagres is one of the longest and most vital of the approximately 150 rivers that flow into the Caribbean. Part of this river was dammed to create Gatun Lake, which forms a major part of the transit route between the locks near each end of the canal. Both Gatun Lake and Madden Lake (also filled with water from the R\u00edo Chagres) provide hydroelectricity to the former Canal Zone area. The R\u00edo Chepo, another major source of hydroelectric power, is one of the more than 300 rivers emptying into the Pacific.\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Panama City has a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen Aw), a little drier than a tropical monsoon climate. It sees of precipitation annually. The wet season spans from May through December, and the dry season spans from January through April. Temperatures remain constant throughout the year, averaging around . Sunshine is subdued in Panama because it lies in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where there is a nearly continual cloud formation, even during the dry season.\nPanama's old quarter (or Casco Viejo, Panama) features many architectural styles, from Spanish colonial buildings to French and Antillean townhouses built during the construction of the Panama Canal. The more modern areas of the city have many high-rise buildings, which together form a very dense skyline. There are more than 110 high-rise projects under construction, with 127 already built. The city holds the 45th place in the world by high-rise buildings count.\nThe Centennial Bridge that crosses the Panama Canal earned the American Segmental Bridge Institute prize of excellence, along with seven other bridges in the Americas.\nThe city is located in Panama District, although its metropolitan area also includes some populated areas on the opposite side of the Panama Canal. As in the rest of the country, the city is divided into corregimientos, in which there are many smaller boroughs. The old quarter, known as the Casco Viejo, is located in the corregimiento of San Felipe. San Felipe and twelve other corregimientos form the urban center of the city, including Santa Ana, El Chorrillo, Calidonia, Curund\u00fa, Anc\u00f3n, Bella Vista, Bethania, San Francisco, Juan Diaz, Pueblo Nuevo, Parque Lefevre, and R\u00edo Abajo.\nAs the economic and financial center of the country, Panama City's economy is service-based, heavily weighted toward banking, commerce, and tourism. The economy depends significantly on trade and shipping activities associated with the Panama Canal and port facilities located in Balboa. Panama's status as a convergence zone for capital from around the world due to the canal helped the city establish itself as a prime location for offshore banking and tax planning. Consequently, the economy has relied on accountants and lawyers who help global corporations navigate the regulatory landscape. The city has benefited from significant economic growth in recent years, mainly due to the ongoing expansion of the Panama Canal, an increase in real estate investment, and a relatively stable banking sector. There are around eighty banks in the city, at least fifteen of which are national.\nPanama City is responsible for the production of approximately 55% of the country's GDP. This is because most Panamanian businesses and premises are located in the city and its metro area. It is a stopover for other destinations in the country, as well as a transit point and tourist destination in itself.\nTourism is one of the most important economic activities in terms of revenue generation. This sector of the economy has seen a great deal of growth since the transfer of the Panama Canal Zone at the end of the twentieth century. The number of hotel rooms increased by more than ten-fold, from 1,400 in 1997 to more than 15,000 in 2013, while the number of annual visitors increased from 457,000 in 1999 to 1.4 million in 2011. The city's hotel occupancy rate has always been relatively high, reaching the second highest for any city outside the United States in 2008, after Perth, Australia, and followed by Dubai. However, hotel occupancy rates have dropped since 2009, probably due to the opening of many new luxury hotels. Several international hotel chains, such as Le M\u00e9ridien, Radisson, and RIU, have opened or plan to open new hotels in the city, along with those previously operating under Marriott, Sheraton, InterContinental, and other foreign and local brands. Also, the Trump Organization is building the Trump Ocean Club, its first investment in Latin America, and Hilton Worldwide recently opened its first Garden Inn Panama, at Eusebio A. Morales Avenue and 49A Street West, and more recently The Panamera, the second Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Latin America.\nThe city proper has approximately 880,691 inhabitants in 23 boroughs. The inhabitants of Panama City are commonly referred to as capitalinos and include large numbers of Afro-Panamanians, mestizos, and mulattos, with notable white and Asian minorities. There is a great deal of cultural diversity within the city, which manifests itself in the wide variety of languages commonly spoken, such as German, Portuguese, and English, in addition to Spanish.\nPanam\u00e1 Viejo (\"Old Panama\") is the name used for the architectural vestiges of the Monumental Historic Complex of the first Spanish city founded on the Pacific coast of the Americas by Pedro Arias de Avila on August 15, 1519. This city was the starting point for the expeditions that conquered the Inca Empire in Peru in 1532. It was a stopover point on one of the most important trade routes in the history of the American continent, leading to the famous fairs of Nombre de Dios and Portobelo, where most of the gold and silver that Spain took from the Americas passed through.\nBuilt and settled in 1671 after the destruction of Panama Viejo by the privateer Henry Morgan, the historic district of Panama City (known as Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo, or San Felipe) was conceived as a walled city to protect its settlers against future pirate attacks. It was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2003.\nCasco Antiguo displays a mix of architectural styles that reflect the country's cultural diversity: Caribbean, Republican, art deco, French, and colonial architecture mix in a site comprising around 800 buildings. Most of Panama City's main monuments are located in Casco Antiguo, including the Sal\u00f3n Bolivar, the National Theater (founded in 1908), Las B\u00f3vedas, and Plaza de Francia. There are also many Catholic buildings, such as the Metropolitan Cathedral, the La Merced Church, and the St. Philip Neri Church. The distinctive golden altar at St. Joseph Church was one of the few items saved from Panama Viejo during the 1671 pirate siege. It was buried in mud during the siege and then secretly transported to its present location.\n- The Cinta Costera 3 in Casco Viejo\nUndergoing redevelopment, the old quarter has become one of the city's main tourist attractions, second only to the Panama Canal. Both government and private sectors are working on its restoration. President Ricardo Martinelli built an extension to the Cinta Costera maritime highway viaduct in 2014 named \"Cinta Costera 3\" around the Casco Antiguo.\nBefore the Cinta Costera 3 project was built there were protests. Much of the controversy surrounding the project involved the possibility that Casco Viejo would lose its World Heritage status. On June 28, 2012, UNESCO decided that Casco Viejo will not be put on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger. \nAccording to Professor Rodrigo Mir\u00f3, the first story about Panama was written by Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s and published as part of the Historia General y Natural de Las Indias in 1535. Some poets and novelists born in Panam\u00e1 city are Manuel Mar\u00eda Ayala (1785\u20131824), Amelia Denis de Icaza (1836\u20131911), Dar\u00edo Herrera (1870\u20131914), Ricardo Mir\u00f3 (1883\u20131940), Gaspar Octavio Hern\u00e1ndez (1893\u20131918), Demetrio Korsi (1899\u20131957), Ricardo Berm\u00fadez (1914\u20132000), Joaqu\u00edn Bele\u00f1o (1922\u201388), Ernesto Endara (1932\u2013), Diana Mor\u00e1n (1932\u201387), Jos\u00e9 C\u00f3rdova (1937\u2013), Pedro Rivera (1939\u2013), Moravia Ochoa L\u00f3pez (1941\u2013), Roberto Fern\u00e1ndez Iglesias (1941\u2013), Jarl Ricardo Babot (1946\u2013), Giovanna Benedetti (1949\u2013), Manuel Orestes Nieto (1951\u2013), Mois\u00e9s Pascual (1955\u2013), H\u00e9ctor Miguel Collado (1960\u2013), David Robinson Orobio (1960\u2013), Katia Chiari (1969\u2013), Carlos Oriel Wynter Melo (1971\u2013), Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Pitt\u00ed (1971\u2013), Arturo Wong Sagel (1980\u2013) and Sof\u00eda Santim (1982\u2013).\nOne of the most important Panamanian artists is Alfredo Sinclair. He has worked for over 50 years in abstract art and has produced one of the most important artistic collections in the country. His daughter, Olga Sinclair, has also followed in his footsteps and has become another force in Panamanian art. Another very prominent Panamanian artist is Guillermo Trujillo, known worldwide for his abstract surrealism.\nBrooke Alfaro is Panamanian artist known throughout the world for his uniquely rendered oil paintings.\nAnother prominent artist is Mario Calvit, known as one of the great painters of the generation that flourished in the country between the decades of 1950 and 1970.\nTourism in Panama City includes many different historic sites and locations related to the operation of the Panama Canal. A few of these sites are the following: \n- Las B\u00f3vedas (\"The Vaults\"), a waterfront promenade jutting out into the Pacific;\n- The National Institute of Culture Building and the French embassy across from it;\n- The Cathedral at Plaza de la Catedral;\n- Teatro Nacional, an intimate performance center with outstanding natural acoustics and seating for about 800 guests;\n- Museo del Canal Interoce\u00e1nico (Interoceanic Canal Museum); and\n- Palacio de las Garzas (Heron's Palace), the official name of the presidential palace, named for the numerous herons that inhabit the building.\n- Miraflores Visitors Center at the Miraflores set of Locks on the Pacific Side, with a museum and a simulator of a ship cruising the canal.\nIn addition to these tourist attractions, Panama City offers many different options when it comes to hotel accommodations, including the first Waldorf Astoria hotel to open in Latin America, and many small boutique style hotels that have smaller numbers of guest rooms and offer a more intimate vacation. Nightlife in the city is centered around the Calle Uruguay and Casco Viejo neighborhoods. These neighborhoods contain a variety of different bars and nightclubs that cater to the tourists visiting the city.\nOne of the newer tourist areas of the city is the area immediately east of the Pacific entrance of the canal, known as the Amador Causeway. This area is currently being developed as a tourist center and nightlife destination. The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute operates a station and a small museum open to the public at Culebra Point on the island of Naos. A new museum, the Biomuseo, was recently completed on the causeway in 2014. It was designed by the American architect Frank Gehry, famous for the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and the Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. Just outside the city limits is the Parque Municipal Summit.\nThe United States State Department does not recommend traveling outside of the city due to the lack of accessibility to some areas and the prevalence of organized crime. Within the city, the State Department acknowledges the presence of crimes in the city, some of which include violent acts such as shootings, rape, armed robbery, and intentional kidnapping. The United States State Department also warns tourists about the purchasing of counterfeited or pirated goods, as they may be in violation of local Panamanian laws. In terms of LGBT rights in the city, same sex marriage is not recognized by the government but there are laws in place to prevent discrimination against the LGBT community.\nThroughout the 20th century, Panama City has excelled in boxing, baseball, basketball, and soccer. These sports have produced famous athletes such as Roberto Dur\u00e1n, Rommel Fern\u00e1ndez, Rolando Blackman, Mariano Rivera, and Rod Carew. Today, these sports have clubs and associations that manage their development in the city. Panama Metro is the city's baseball team.

Two other airports serve Panama City: Panam\u00e1 Pac\u00edfico, previously the Howard Air Force Base, and Marcos A. Gelabert, previously the Albrook Air Force Base. Pac\u00edfico serves VivaColombia and Wingo, while Marcos A. Gelabert Airport is the main hub for AirPanama. All other flights are served by Tocumen.\nThere are frequent traffic jams in Panama City due to the high levels of private transport ownership per kilometre of traffic lane. In an attempt to curb traffic jams, President Ricardo Martinelli has brought forward the citywide Panama Metro, initially long, stretching across the city.\nThe bus terminal located in Ancon offers buses in and out of the city. Bus service is one of the most widely used forms of transportation in Panama. The terminal receives thousands of passengers daily from locations like David, Chiriqui, and the central provinces of Herrera and Los Santos. The terminal also receives international passengers from Central America via the Pan-American Highway.\nPanama City offers transportation services through yellow taxis. Taxis do not use a meter to measure fares, instead using a zone system for fares that is published by the Autoridad de Transito y Transporte Terrestre, Panama's transit authority. \nPanama City is twinned with:\n- Fort Lauderdale, USA\n- Guadalajara, Mexico\n- Incheon, South Korea\n- Kaohsiung, Taiwan\n- Miami, USA\n- Taipei, Taiwan (1989)\n- Tel Aviv, Israel\nPanama City is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from 12 October 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n- Andorra la Vella, Andorra\n- Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay\n- Bogot\u00e1, Colombia\n- Buenos Aires, Argentina\n- Caracas, Venezuela\n- Davao City, Philippines\n- Guatemala City, Guatemala\n- Havana, Cuba\n- Quito, Ecuador\n- La Paz, Bolivia\n- Lima, Peru\n- Lisbon, Portugal\n- Madrid, Spain\n- Manila, Philippines\n- Managua, Nicaragua\n- Mexico City, Mexico\n- Montevideo, Uruguay\n- Panama City, Panama\n- Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n- San Jose, Costa Rica\n- San Juan, Puerto Rico\n- San Salvador, El Salvador\n- Santiago, Chile\n- Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n- Tegucigalpa, Honduras\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 3645, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3645, "length": 1966, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5611, "length": 514, "sectionHeading": "Geography | Climate", "sectionLabel": "city.climate"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6125, "length": 635, "sectionHeading": "Cityscape | Architecture", "sectionLabel": "city.architecture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6760, "length": 586, "sectionHeading": "Cityscape | Neighborhoods", "sectionLabel": "city.district"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7346, "length": 2469, "sectionHeading": "Economy", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 9815, "length": 452, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 10267, "length": 580, "sectionHeading": "Culture | World Heritage Sites | Panam\u00e1 Viejo", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 10847, "length": 1762, "sectionHeading": "Culture | World Heritage Sites | Casco Viejo or Casco Antiguo", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 12609, "length": 959, "sectionHeading": "Culture | Literature", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 13568, "length": 682, "sectionHeading": "Culture | Art", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 14250, "length": 2694, "sectionHeading": "Culture | Tourism", "sectionLabel": "city.culture"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 16944, "length": 974, "sectionHeading": "Culture | Sports", "sectionLabel": "city.sport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 17918, "length": 1049, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 18967, "length": 369, "sectionHeading": "Healthcare", "sectionLabel": "city.health"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 19336, "length": 1360, "sectionHeading": "Transportation", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 20696, "length": 173, "sectionHeading": "Twin towns \u2013 sister cities", "sectionLabel": "city.international_affairs"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 20869, "length": 717, "sectionHeading": "Twin towns \u2013 sister cities | Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities", "sectionLabel": "city.international_affairs"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montpelier,_Indiana", "type": "city", "title": "Montpelier, Indiana", "abstract": "Montpelier is a city in Blackford County, Indiana, United States. This small rural community, the county's first to be platted, was established by settlers from Vermont, and is named after Vermont's capital city of Montpelier.\nMontpelier was a central participant in the Indiana Gas Boom, as natural gas was discovered near the community in 1887. More importantly, the county's first successful oil well was drilled on the south side of Montpelier in 1890. Its population quickly grew from 808 in 1890 to about 6,500 by 1896. The Gas Boom, mostly an oil boom for Montpelier, gradually ended during the first decade of the 20th century.\nLike many boom towns, the city's population has never matched that of the boom years. The city's population was 1,805 at the 2010 census. However, the city's population stabilized many decades ago, and the community has multiple industries and an active community association. Montpelier is located near the former Godfroy Indian Reservation, and a statue of an Indian is featured prominently in the downtown district.\n", "text": "In 1836 and 1837, several groups of settlers from Vermont moved to East Central Indiana, and settled on the high ground on the south side of the Salamonie River. Abel Baldwin, a veteran of the War of 1812, was the leader of this group of Vermont natives. They named their community Montpelier, after the capital of their original home state. Baldwin and his son-in-law, civil engineer John Cook, surveyed the area in 1836, and it was platted on September 5, 1837. The original plat had 16 blocks with a total of 154 lots.\nAt the time Montpelier was settled, it was part of Jay County. The western portion of Jay County was split away in 1838 to form Blackford County. Montpelier was not the first community in what would become Blackford County \u2013 a village named Matamoras existed earlier. However, Montpelier was platted first, and Matamoras was essentially a ghost town after the 1880s.\nBeginning in September 1870, the Fort Wayne, Cincinnati & Louisville Railroad connected Fort Wayne with Muncie, Indiana, and Montpelier was (and still is) on this line. With dramatically improved transportation for the community, Montpelier became incorporated as a town at the end of 1870. By that time, the town had grown to a population of 231.\nIn 1887, natural gas was discovered in Blackford County, and the area began its participation in the Indiana Gas Boom. While natural gas was found throughout Blackford County, crude oil was found mostly in the county's Harrison Township, which includes Montpelier. Blackford County's first successful oil well, located just south of Montpelier, began producing during 1890. Montpelier was thought to be \"the very heart of the greatest natural gas and oil field in the world\". By the mid-1890s, about two-thirds of Harrison Township (25 square miles) was considered part of an oil-producing region. Montpelier became a city where \u201cmoney and whiskey flowed frequently\u201d, and numerous other \u201crecreational activities\u201d were available. Oil production from the Trenton Gas and Oil Field surrounding Montpelier began decreasing during the first decade of the 20th century, and the Gas Boom (or Montpelier's oil boom) gradually came to an end. Montpelier began a return to normalcy and its population (like many boom towns) has never exceeded its Gas Boom peak.\nThe Montpelier National Bank was robbed by three men on the afternoon of August 4, 1933. The robbery lasted about ten minutes, and no shooting was involved. The robbers quietly left town, driving east on Indiana State Road 18, without being followed. It was later determined, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that the robbers were John Dillinger and the Dillinger Gang.\nMontpelier is part of East Central Indiana and Northern Indiana. Future Northern Indiana, including what became Harrison Township and Montpelier, was flattened by two glaciers millions of years ago. These glaciers are also responsible for the rich Blackford County farmland, which includes the land surrounding Montpelier.\nLocated in the Harrison Township portion of Blackford County, Indiana, Montpelier is adjacent to the Salamonie River. It is located south of Fort Wayne, Indiana, and northeast of Indianapolis.\nAccording to the 2010 census, Montpelier has a total area of , all land.\nMontpelier has a typical Midwestern humid continental seasonal climate. There are four distinct seasons, with winters being cold with moderate snowfall, while summers can be warm and humid. The highest average temperature is in July at 84 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C), while the lowest average temperature is in January at 18 \u00b0F (\u22128 \u00b0C). However, summer temperatures can top 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C), and winter temperatures can drop below 0 \u00b0F (\u221217 \u00b0C). Average monthly precipitation ranges from about 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm), with the heaviest occurring during June, July, and August. The highest recorded temperature was 103.0 \u00b0F (39.0 \u00b0C) on June 26, 1988, and the lowest recorded temperature was \u221226.0 \u00b0F (\u221232.0 \u00b0C) on January 19, 1994.\nAlthough Montpelier's peak population shown in the adjacent table (source: U.S. Census) is 3,405, the city is thought to have had over 6,500 residents around 1896 during the Indiana Gas Boom.\nAt the 2010 census, there were 1,805 people, 708 households and 470 families residing in the city.

The Southwestern Coal and Improvement Company, a subsidiary of the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway (MK&T) developed the site. A tent city sprung up, followed by company-built houses. Work on the mine started January 2, 1889, and the first shipment of coal left Liddle on April 17, 1889. The town name changed to Coalgate on January 23, 1890. The new name was taken from the steel gate or \"coal gate\" that separated the trains from the coal mines north of town. Coalgate incorporated under the laws of Arkansas on November 25, 1898.

Coalgate's population peaked at 3,009 at the 1920 census and has never recovered.\nCoalgate survived the Great Depression, although many of its businesses did not. After President Franklin D. Roosevelt's election, various Federal programs, such as the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), National Youth Administration (NYA), and Works Progress Administration (WPA), helped buoy the city's struggling economy. The onset of World War II brought a temporary respite to the coal industry. However, these mines closed by 1958.\nCoalgate is located at (34.533662, -96.218727).

The area of Galena Park began as the settlement of Clinton in 1835. The center of what would become Galena Park was a tract that Batterson purchased from the estate of Ezekiel Thomas. The settlement originally served as a farming and ranching community but in the 1880s transformed into a railroad center along the new Port of Houston. With the coming of the petrochemical industry in the early 1900s, Clinton again transformed into a refinery center.\nClinton attempted to establish a post office in 1935, but the request was denied as another Clinton, Texas had established the name. The settlement's name was changed to Galena Park after the Galena Signal Oil Company of Texas, which built the first refinery there. Galena Park's original name survives today as the name of a major street in the city, Clinton Drive. Because of the 1935 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Galena Park's territory into its city limits, while Houston annexed surrounding areas that were unincorporated.

Since the 1940s area residents considered the city to be a part of Greater Houston.\nThe economy of Galena Park began to suffer in the early 1980s, when cranes used to haul ship cargo were reduced; prior to the early 1980s a team of workers who took up to one week to load cargo off of a ship stayed in the port city and contributed to its local economy, but the new technology lead to ships unloading all cargo in less than one day.

It was long presented as derived from the name of an eponymous founder in Swiss legend, one Suito or Switer, an explanation found in Swiss school textbooks until the first half of the 20th century. There is currently no consensus on the name's derivation. A Germanic etymology was suggested by Gatschet (1867), deriving the name from an Old High German verb \"to burn\" (referring to slash-and-burn clearing of woodland for habitation). Brandstetter (1871) is critical of Gatschet's suggestion and prefers derivation from an Alemannic personal name in Svid- as it were presenting a scholarly defense of the Suito of the founding legend. \nThe etymology proposed for the by Hubschmied (1929) derives the name from a Gallo-Roman * , from the Gaulish or Latin word for \"\", via a Romance * \"(mountain, pasture) of pigs\" yielding an Alemannic . Hubschmied himself distanced himself from this opinion in 1961, preferring an unspecified pre-Roman (or \"Etruscan\") source.\nSonderegger (1966) revisits Gatschet's \"slash-and-burn\" proposal, but now claims derivation from a cognate Celtic root, * , Proto-Celtic * with a meaning of \"clearing\" or similar, giving Gaulish * (the long vowel as in \"Rhine\"), Gallo-Romance *Sv\u0113dus, -is, and finally in Old High German by the 8th century.\nThe name was extended to the area dominated by Schwyz (the Canton of Schwyz), and later to the entire Old Swiss Confederacy. Other cantons tended to resent this in the 15th century, but after 1499 the term was widely self-adopted, out of spite so to speak, since it had been employed as a term of abuse by the Swabian side during the Swabian War. and (the origin of the English name Switzerland) could be used interchangeably as country names in the 16th century.\nThe Swiss German pronunciation [\u0283vi\u02d0ts] is homophonous for the name of the town and that of the country (the two are distinguished only by use of the definite article for the latter, [\u0283vi\u02d0ts] \"Schwyz\", [t\u0283vi\u02d0ts] \"Switzerland\"). The spelling of y for [i\u02d0] originates as a ligature ij in 15th-century handwriting.\nWhile a few Roman era coins have been found in Schwyz, the earliest evidence of a settlement comes from the 8th century. The Alamanni cemetery at the parish church and the church itself are both from the first half of the 8th century. This first church was followed by a second ottonian church around 1000, which may have been destroyed by the 1117 Verona earthquake. In 1121 the third church building, a romanesque building, was consecrated. This was followed in the 15th Century by the much larger fourth church which was destroyed, along with much of the village, by fire in 1642. The fifth church, an early baroque church was replaced because of serious structural defects by the current late baroque church which was dedicated in 1774.\nBecause Schwyz was the capital of a canton, many of the government organizations administered both the town and the canton at the same time, and the history of the town is closely tied to the history of the canton.\nAccording to the chronicle of Johann Stumpf from 1548, the old town originally consisted of a village square, the church and its cemetery, the town hall, the inn, the archive tower and a number of scattered wooden houses. Around 1500, to distinguish it from the Canton of Schwyz, Schwyz town was often called Kilchgassen, which meant the village around the church but not the surrounding villages. The fire of 1642, which destroyed 47 buildings in the center of the village, allowed the town to be totally rebuilt. A new, larger town square with major roads radiating out was built in front of the new church and the new city hall. The houses were rebuilt as urban townhouses and ring of about 30 large patrician farm houses grew up surrounding the village center.\nBesides the town of Schwyz, the municipality includes the settlements of Ibach, Seewen and Rickenbach. To the east, the municipality includes, or borders on, the mountains of Hochstuckli, Kleiner Mythen, Grosser Mythen, Rotenflue, and Furggelenstock.

The station is served by InterRegio und S-Bahn trains.\nEarly plans for the Schweizerische S\u00fcdostbahn included a proposal for what is now the Pf\u00e4ffikon SZ\u2013Arth-Goldau railway to terminate at Brunnen railway station instead of Arth-Goldau railway station. If that proposal had come to fruition, the Schwyz town centre would have had a railway station - initially on the Kollegi football field, and later in Steisteg.\nFrom 6 October 1900 to 14 December 1963, the Schwyzer Strassenbahnen linked the Schwyz railway station with the town centre. On 8 May 1915, the additional section between Schwyz and Brunnen See was opened \u2013 and on the same day, the Schwyz SBB\u2013Schwyz line was shut down. The trams were eventually replaced by the Auto AG Schwyz, which today operates 12 bus lines in the cantons of Lucerne and Schwyz.\nThe Rotenfluebahn, a gondola lift, links Rickenbach with the summit of the Rotenfluh mountain, which is, in summer, a popular vantage point over the Lake Lucerne region, and, in winter, a ski area.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 2378, "sectionHeading": "Name", "sectionLabel": "city.etymology"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2378, "length": 1721, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4099, "length": 717, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4816, "length": 99, "sectionHeading": "Coat of arms", "sectionLabel": "city.etymology"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4915, "length": 2471, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7386, "length": 943, "sectionHeading": "Heritage sites of national significance", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 8329, "length": 289, "sectionHeading": "Politics", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 8618, "length": 1538, "sectionHeading": "Economy", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 10156, "length": 878, "sectionHeading": "Religion", "sectionLabel": "city.faith"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 11034, "length": 1806, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 12840, "length": 464, "sectionHeading": "Weather", "sectionLabel": "city.other"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 13304, "length": 1746, "sectionHeading": "Transport", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomington,_Illinois", "type": "city", "title": "Bloomington, Illinois", "abstract": "Bloomington is a city in and the county seat of McLean County, Illinois, United States.

Springing from the settlement of Keg Grove, later called Blooming Grove, Bloomington was named as county seat on December 25, 1830, when McLean County was created.\nWhen the County of McLean was incorporated, a county seat was established. However, the legislation stated the site of Bloomington \"would be located later.\" James Allin, one of the new county's promoters, offered to donate of his land for the new town. His offer was accepted, and Bloomington was laid out. Its lots were sold at a well-attended and noisy auction on the 4th of July 1831. At this time there were few roads, but rich soils brought new farmers who began commerce by conducting their business in the newly formed county. People came from all over to trade and do business at the town's center, known today as Downtown Bloomington, including Abraham Lincoln who was working as a lawyer in nearby Springfield, Illinois.\nIn 1900 an officer on patrol discovered a fire in a laundry across the street from the old City Hall and Police Station.

However, the burnt area was quickly rebuilt from the designs of local architects George Miller and Paul O. Moratz.\nDuring the first two decades of the 20th century, Bloomington continued to grow. Agriculture, the construction of highways and railroads, and the growth of the insurance business (mainly State Farm Insurance) all influenced the growth of Bloomington and its downtown area.

Property Developer John J. Lawrence, who hailed from Pennsylvania, noticed the area on a visit to Lake Brooklyn, and instantly became attracted to the region. \nIn 1921, the Lawrence family completed their home, the first house built in Keystone Heights, which overlooked Lake Geneva, and still lies there today at the corner of Jasmine Street & Lakeview Drive. The town would be incorporated as Keystone Heights, named after Lawrence's home state of Pennsylvania's nickname, the \"Keystone\" state, in 1925.\nAfter hearing of natural wonders and the many different lakes of the area, other families moved to Keystone, putting a strain on those attempting to build structures within the city. Helping to address the issue, in late 1922, C. Ray Lawrence came to Keystone Heights, and began laying out the streets and lots in the town.\nThe next particularly significant event would come on New Year's Day in 1924, when the Keystone Inn opened. The inn was host to many events throughout the community, and essentially became an icon for the town.\nTourists visiting the Inn would also frequent the Chautauqua. A large open pit that effectively served as a type of amphitheater, the Chautauqua served as a beacon for various musicians, artists, and speakers from the Chautauqua circuit in New York.\nWithin just two years, people were traveling to the Keystone Inn and the community of Keystone Heights from great distances to experience the town for themselves. The small community boasted a public beach with a pavilion, picnic grounds and a nine-hole golf course. \nThese events brought a variety of travelers, such as the University of Florida football team, which would stay at the Inn before their homecoming games. \nThe inn no longer exists. It burned in October 1954, and was never rebuilt. Today, the former property of the inn is a park in front of City Hall. \nThe city gained the Keystone Heights school in 1926. As the city rapidly grew, the school began to expand as well, and in 1963, Keystone Heights High School and Keystone Heights Elementary were established on the property of what is today the elementary school.\nIn September 1974, the high school moved to its present-day location across the street, and became Keystone Heights Junior/Senior High School.\nIn 2017 local beloved citizen Matt Morris ran and was elected Mayor of Keystone Heights.

The city is also one of the major producers of rice and vegetables in the province, even providing the needs of neighboring municipalities and provinces. \n", "text": "The name \"Bayugan\" is a Manobo term for pathway, since then the natives called the place, Bayugan. Another version states that \"bayug\" trees grew abundantly in this place. It was also believed that the natives used to make this place their meeting spot and that the means of gathering the inhabitants was by knocking on a hollow piece of wood which they termed as the \"bayug.\"\nBayugan was formerly a sitio of Barangay Maygatasan, Esperanza. Several versions abound on how the sitio got its name. First, the place was located along the river which served as the pathway of the natives in going to Esperanza.\nIn 1942, Japanese troops entered Bayugan.\nIn 1945, the town of Bayugan in Southern Agusan was liberated by Filipino soldiers and guerrillas from the Japanese forces occupying the town.\nIn 1948, the Department of Public Works and Highways conducted a survey for a National Highway that would connect Butuan with Davao City. Simultaneously, the Bureau of Lands surveyed the places that would be traversed by the proposed road. Possible town sites were identified and among them was Barangay Maygatasan. However, part of the National Highway (now the Narra Avenue) passed through the sitio of Bayugan instead of Barangay Maygatasan. Migrants started settling in the sitio of Bayugan, thus, prompting the transfer of the proposed town site.\nIn the early part of 1960, the inhabitants led by Mr. Jose Joson passed a resolution creating the sitio of Bayugan into a regular barrio. In April of that year, Barangay Bayugan was inaugurated with Joson as the Teniente del Barrio. Brought about by the construction of the National Highway which traversed the place, business activity sprouted rapidly in the area.\nA year later, barangay officials led by then Sergio Mullaneda worked out the creation of Bayugan into a regular municipality through the assistance of Governor Democrito O. Plaza, Governor of Agusan. By virtue of Executive Order No. 440 of then President Carlos P. Garcia, the petition to create the municipality of Bayugan was granted on August 6, 1961. Mr. Mullaneda, the first appointed Municipal Mayor of Bayugan assumed into office on August 6, 1962 during the term of President Diosdado Macapagal. In the year 2007 Bayugan was converted to a city.\nBayugan is a transportation highway nexus for the eastern part of Mindanao Island. Bayugan is now one if not the fastest growing component city in North Eastern Mindanao.\nDuring the 11th Congress (1998\u20132001), Congress enacted into law 33 bills converting 33 municipalities into cities. However, Congress did not act on a further 24 bills converting 24 other municipalities into cities. \nDuring the 12th Congress (2001\u20132004), Congress enacted into law Republic Act No. 9009 (RA 9009), which took effect on 30 June 2001. RA 9009 amended Section 450 of the Local Government Code by increasing the annual income requirement for conversion of a municipality into a city from   20 million to   100 million. The rationale for the amendment was to restrain, in the words of Senator Aquilino Pimentel, \"the mad rush\" of municipalities to convert into cities solely to secure a larger share in the Internal Revenue Allotment despite the fact that they are incapable of fiscal independence.\nAfter RA 9009 went into effect, the House of Representatives of the 12th Congress adopted Joint Resolution No. 29, which sought to exempt from the   100 million income requirement in RA 9009 the 24 municipalities whose cityhood bills were not approved in the 11th Congress. However, the 12th Congress ended without the Senate having approved Joint Resolution No. 29.\nDuring the 13th Congress (2004\u20132007), the House of Representatives re-adopted former Joint Resolution No. 29 as Joint Resolution No. 1 and forwarded it to the Senate for approval. However, the Senate again failed to approve the Joint Resolution. Following the suggestion of Senator Aquilino Pimentel (Senate President), 16 municipalities filed, through their respective sponsors, individual cityhood bills.

The Senate also approved the cityhood bills in February 2007, except that of Naga, Cebu which was passed on 7 June 2007. These cityhood bills lapsed into law on various dates from March to July 2007 after President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo failed to sign them.\nThe point of law at issue in 2007 was whether there had been a breach of Section 10, Article X of the 1987 Constitution, which provides \u2013 \u2013 and in each case the established criteria were far from met.\nIn November 2008, and 15 other cities lost their cityhood after the Supreme Court of the Philippines granted a petition filed by the League of Cities of the Philippines, and declared unconstitutional the cityhood law (RA ) which had allowed the town to acquire its city status. The Supreme Court ruled that they did not pass the requirements for cityhood.\nOn none }} , the 16 cities affected acting together filed a motion for reconsideration with the Supreme Court. More than a year later, on none }} , acting on said appeal, the Court reversed its earlier ruling as it ruled that \"at the end of the day, the passage of the amendatory law\" (regarding the criteria for cityhood as set by Congress) \"is no different from the enactment of a law, i.e., the cityhood laws specifically exempting a particular political subdivision from the criteria earlier mentioned. Congress, in enacting the exempting law/s, effectively decreased the already codified indicators.\" Accordingly cityhood status was restored.\nBut on none }} , the 16 cities lost their city status again, after the Supreme Court voted 7-6, with two justices not taking part, to reinstate the 2008 decision declaring as \"unconstitutional\" the Republic Acts that converted the 16 municipalities into cities. A previous law required towns aspiring to become cities to earn at least   100 million annually, which none of the 16 did.\nOn none }} , the Supreme Court made another volte-face and upheld for the third time the cityhood of 16 towns in the Philippines.\nFinally, on none }} , the Supreme Court, in an en banc ruling delivered in Baguio City, affirmed the finality of the constitutionality of the 16 cityhood laws by resolving that: \nOn none }} the Supreme Court directed the Clerk of Court to issue the entry of judgment on the cityhood case of 16 municipalities. \nOn July 24, 2006, congress approved R.A. 9405, an act converting the Municipality of Bayugan into a component city to be known as the City of Bayugan.\nBut in 2008, the Supreme Court of the Philippines declared the law unconstitutional. The court ruled that Bayugan, along with the other fifteen cities covered by the law did not meet the requirements for cityhood.\nMore than a year later, on December 22, 2009, acting favorably on the appeal of the sixteen affected cities, the Supreme Court reversed its earlier ruling. It deemed that the passage of the amendatory law regarding the criteria for cityhood as set by Congress specifically exempting a particular political subdivision therefrom was constitutional. The court further ruled that congress, in enacting the exempting law, effectively decreased the already codified indicators. As such, the cityhood status of Bayugan, and the rest of the fifteen local government units was restored.\nBut again on August 24, 2010, in a 16-page resolution, the Supreme Court reinstated its November 18, 2008 decision striking down the constitutionality of Republic Act 9405. Voting 7-6, with two justices abstaining, the SC reinstated its decision declaring RA 9405 as unconstitutional.\nHowever, in another twist of fate for Bayugan, the Supreme Court once again upheld for the 3rd time and final time the constitutionality of RA 9405 on February 17, 2011, thereby finalizing the cityhood of Bayugan and the other fifteen LGUs affected by the law. On July 3, 2011, the Supreme Court ordered its Clerk of Court to issue an entry of judgment on the cityhood case, sealing with finality the constitutionality of the law.\nBayugan is bordered by the Municipality of Sibagat and the province of Surigao del Sur to the north; the Municipality of Prosperidad to the east; the Municipality of Esperanza to the south; and the Municipality of Las Nieves, Agusan del Norte, to the west.\nThe city is geographically situated below the typhoon belt but is usually affected by depressions forming in the typhoon regions of Visayas and the province of Surigao del Norte.

It was platted in 1904, though it lost two-thirds of its population between 1900 and 1910. The mining district was composed first of placer mines, but soon many lode gold mines developed. The city was incorporated in 1903 and had a population of 28 in 1910. It continued as a viable community until 1942 when gold mining was made illegal by Federal Public Law 208 during World War II.\nIn later years, the old Greenhorn Jail (dating to around 1910) was removed to Canyon City under suspicious circumstances. A court case ensued for its return, but because the city straddles the Blue Mountain ridge, the district attorneys of Baker County and Grant County could not even agree in which court house it should be held. The case was eventually heard by the Circuit Court for Grant County in Canyon City, Oregon. The jail remains in Canyon City, Oregon. \nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.\nThe city is surrounded by the Malheur National Forest and Wallowa\u2013Whitman National Forest.\nAt above sea level, Greenhorn is the highest incorporated city in Oregon. It is also unique in that the city was established on land that was originally patented from the United States for the purpose of platting the city (rather than being homesteaded by individuals).

Much of the city's southern border is shared with the Talladega National Forest.\nMajor bodies of water include Oxford Lake, Lake Hillabee, Snows Creek and Choccolocco Creek, which bisects the city.\nFounded in the early 1850s, Oxford was the first city in Calhoun County to be incorporated, in 1852. The name \"Oxford\" was due to the presence of a narrow crossing of Chocolocco Creek that allowed farmers to ford cattle from one side of the creek to the other. Since 1970, Oxford has annexed large amounts of land to the south and west, including the communities of Coldwater and Bynum. In 1970, it was all in Calhoun County, but today it includes areas in Talladega County.\nA smaller municipality, Hobson City, was once a part of Oxford. The area, then known as the Mooree Quarter, is one square mile, and is located north and west of Oxford, and south and west of Anniston. In the last years of the 19th century, according to tradition, in the course of political elections, a black man managed to be elected justice of the peace in Oxford. This being unacceptable to the city fathers, they appealed to the powers in the state capital, and an 'arrangement' was made. The city boundaries were redrawn, in similar fashion to a gerrymander, and the quarter was excluded, becoming a town unto itself. The new town became incorporated on August 16, 1899 as Hobson City, taking the name of a naval hero of the Spanish\u2013American War. The intention was that the largely black population of this quarter would no longer skew the elections of the now almost exclusively white Oxford. Another result was the creation of only the second town in the United States (after Eatonville, Florida) with 100% black government, and an almost 100% black population (at least at first).\nOxford features a mayor-council form of government, though the mayor actually dictates the daily running of the city. Replacing Mayor Leon Smith who retired from office after his eighth term (began in 1984), is Alton Craft, who has been the Finance Director for Oxford for over two decades.

A new Oxford High School building opened in August 2010, as well as a new Technical Building to be finished by the end of 2014.\nOxford High School has an approximate enrollment of 1,002 students and is classified as a Class 6A school. Oxford City Schools offer excellent educational opportunities. Oxford City Schools current superintendent is Dr. Jeff Goodwin.\nThe city's growth in recent years can be attributed mainly to the presence of Interstate 20 and Oxford's central location between Atlanta and Birmingham. The Quintard Mall is the only fully enclosed shopping mall between Birmingham and Douglasville, Georgia.

Located on the east bank of the Hooghly River, it is the principal commercial, cultural, and educational centre of East India, while the Port of Kolkata is India's oldest operating port and its sole major riverine port. In 2011, the city had a population of 4.5 million, while the population of the city and its suburbs was 14.1 million, making it the third-most populous metropolitan area in India. Recent estimates of Kolkata Metropolitan Area's economy have ranged from $60 to $150 billion (GDP adjusted for purchasing power parity) making it third most-productive metropolitan area in India, after Mumbai and Delhi. Kolkata (] ) was formerly known as Calcutta , the official name until 2001.\nIn the late 17th century, the three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty. After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690, the area was developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post. Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756, and the East India Company retook it the following year. In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish Nizamat (local rule), and assumed full sovereignty of the region. Under the company rule, and later under the British Raj, Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 1911, when its perceived geographical disadvantages, combined with growing nationalism in Bengal, led to a shift of the capital to New Delhi. Calcutta was the centre for the Indian independence movement; it remains a hotbed of contemporary state politics. Following Indian independence in 1947, Kolkata, which was once the centre of modern Indian education, science, culture, and politics, suffered several decades of economic stagnation.\nAs a nucleus of the 19th- and early 20th-century Bengal Renaissance and a religiously and ethnically diverse centre of culture in Bengal and India, Kolkata has local traditions in drama, art, film, theatre, and literature. Many people from Kolkata\u2014among them several Nobel laureates\u2014have contributed to the arts, the sciences, and other areas. Kolkata culture features idiosyncrasies that include distinctively close-knit neighbourhoods (paras) and freestyle intellectual exchanges (adda). West Bengal's share of the Bengali film industry is based in the city, which also hosts venerable cultural institutions of national importance, such as the Academy of Fine Arts, the Victoria Memorial, the Asiatic Society, the Indian Museum and the National Library of India. Among professional scientific institutions, Kolkata hosts the Agri Horticultural Society of India, the Geological Survey of India, the Botanical Survey of India, the Calcutta Mathematical Society, the Indian Science Congress Association, the Zoological Survey of India, the Institution of Engineers, the Anthropological Survey of India and the Indian Public Health Association. Though home to major cricketing venues and franchises, Kolkata differs from other Indian cities by giving importance to association football and other sports.\n", "text": "The word Kolkata derives from the Bengali term K\u00f4likata ( ) [\u02c8k\u0254likat\u032aa], the name of one of three villages that predated the arrival of the British, in the area where the city eventually was to be established; the other two villages were Sutanuti and Govindapur.\nThere are several explanations about the etymology of this name:\n- The term Kolikata is thought to be a variation of Kalikkhetr\u00f4 [\u02c8kalik\u02b0\u02d0et\u032ar\u0254] ( ), meaning \"Field of [the goddess] Kali\". Similarly, it can be a variation of 'Kalikshetra' (Sanskrit: \u0915\u093e\u0932\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930, lit. \"area of Goddess Kali\").\n- Another theory is that the name derives from Kalighat.\n- Alternatively, the name may have been derived from the Bengali term kilkila ( ), or \"flat area\".\n- The name may have its origin in the words khal [\u02c8k\u02b0al] ( ) meaning \"canal\", followed by ka\u1e6da [\u02c8kata] ( ), which may mean \"dug\".\n- According to another theory, the area specialised in the production of quicklime or koli chun [\u02c8k\u0254lit\u0255un] ( ) and coir or kata [\u02c8kat\u032aa] ( ); hence, it was called Kolikata [\u02c8k\u0254likat\u032aa] ( ).\nAlthough the city's name has always been pronounced Kolkata [\u02c8kolkat\u032aa] ( ) or K\u00f4likata [\u02c8k\u0254likat\u032aa] ( ) in Bengali, the anglicised form Calcutta was the official name until 2001, when it was changed to Kolkata in order to match Bengali pronunciation.\nThe discovery and archaeological study of Chandraketugarh, north of Kolkata, provide evidence that the region in which the city stands has been inhabited for over two millennia. Kolkata's recorded history began in 1690 with the arrival of the English East India Company, which was consolidating its trade business in Bengal. Job Charnock, an administrator who worked for the company, was formerly credited as the founder of the city; In response to a public petition, the Calcutta High Court ruled in 2003 that the city does not have a founder. The area occupied by the present-day city encompassed three villages: Kalikata, Gobindapur, and Sutanuti. Kalikata was a fishing village; Sutanuti was a riverside weavers' village. They were part of an estate belonging to the Mughal emperor; the jagirdari (a land grant bestowed by a king on his noblemen) taxation rights to the villages were held by the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family of landowners, or zamindars. These rights were transferred to the East India Company in 1698. \nIn 1712, the British completed the construction of Fort William, located on the east bank of the Hooghly River to protect their trading factory. Facing frequent skirmishes with French forces, the British began to upgrade their fortifications in 1756. The Nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud-Daulah, condemned the militarisation and tax evasion by the company. His warning went unheeded, and the Nawab attacked; he captured Fort William which led to the killings of several East India company officials in the Black Hole of Calcutta. A force of Company soldiers (sepoys) and British troops led by Robert Clive recaptured the city the following year. Per the 1765 Treaty of Allahabad following the battle of Buxar, East India company was appointed imperial tax collector of the Mughal emperor in the province of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, while Mughal-appointed Nawabs continued to rule the province. Declared a presidency city, Calcutta became the headquarters of the East India Company by 1773. In 1793, ruling power of the Nawabs were abolished and East India company took complete control of the city and the province. In the early 19th century, the marshes surrounding the city were drained; the government area was laid out along the banks of the Hooghly River. Richard Wellesley, Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William between 1797 and 1805, was largely responsible for the development of the city and its public architecture. Throughout the late 18th and 19th century, the city was a centre of the East India Company's opium trade.\nBy the 1850s, Calcutta had two areas: White Town, which was primarily British and centred on Chowringhee and Dalhousie Square; and Black Town, mainly Indian and centred on North Calcutta. The city underwent rapid industrial growth starting in the early 1850s, especially in the textile and jute industries; this encouraged British companies to massively invest in infrastructure projects, which included telegraph connections and Howrah railway station. The coalescence of British and Indian culture resulted in the emergence of a new babu class of urbane Indians, whose members were often bureaucrats, professionals, newspaper readers, and Anglophiles; they usually belonged to upper-caste Hindu communities. In the 19th century, the Bengal Renaissance brought about an increased sociocultural sophistication among city denizens. In 1883, Calcutta was host to the first national conference of the Indian National Association, the first avowed nationalist organisation in India.\nThe British moved the capital to New Delhi in 1911. Calcutta continued to be a centre for revolutionary organisations associated with the Indian independence movement. The city and its port were bombed several times by the Japanese between 1942 and 1944, during World War II. Coinciding with the war, millions starved to death during the Bengal famine of 1943 due to a combination of military, administrative, and natural factors. Demands for the creation of a Muslim state led in 1946 to an episode of communal violence that killed over 4,000. The partition of India led to further clashes and a demographic shift\u2014many Muslims left for East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh), while hundreds of thousands of Hindus fled into the city.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, severe power shortages, strikes, and a violent Marxist\u2013Maoist movement by groups known as the Naxalites damaged much of the city's infrastructure, resulting in economic stagnation. The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 led to a massive influx of thousands of refugees, many of them penniless, that strained Kolkata's infrastructure. During the mid-1980s, Mumbai (then called Bombay) overtook Kolkata as India's most populous city. In 1985, prime minister Rajiv Gandhi dubbed Kolkata a \"dying city\" in light of its socio-political woes. In the period 1977\u20132011, West Bengal was governed from Kolkata by the Left Front, which was dominated by the Communist Party of India (CPM). It was the world's longest-serving democratically elected communist government, during which Kolkata was a key base for Indian communism. In the West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, 2011, Left Front was defeated by the Trinamool Congress. The city's economic recovery gathered momentum after the 1990s, when India began to institute pro-market reforms. Since 2000, the information technology (IT) services sector has revitalised Kolkata's stagnant economy. The city is also experiencing marked growth in its manufacturing base.\nSpread roughly north\u2013south along the east bank of the Hooghly River, Kolkata sits within the lower Ganges Delta of eastern India; the city's elevation is . Much of the city was originally a wetland that was reclaimed over the decades to accommodate a burgeoning population. The remaining undeveloped areas, known as the East Kolkata Wetlands, were designated a \"wetland of international importance\" by the Ramsar Convention (1975). As with most of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, the soil and water are predominantly alluvial in origin. Kolkata is located over the \"Bengal basin\", a pericratonic tertiary basin. Bengal basin comprises three structural units: shelf or platform in the west; central hinge or shelf/slope break; and deep basinal part in the east and southeast. Kolkata is located atop the western part of the hinge zone which is about wide at a depth of about below the surface. The shelf and hinge zones have many faults, among them some are active. Total thickness of sediment below Kolkata is nearly above the crystalline basement; of these the top is Quaternary, followed by of Tertiary sediments, trap wash of Cretaceous trap and Permian-Carboniferous Gondwana rocks. The quaternary sediments consist of clay, silt, and several grades of sand and gravel. These sediments are sandwiched between two clay beds: the lower one at a depth of ; the upper one in thickness. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, on a scale ranging from I to V in order of increasing susceptibility to earthquakes, the city lies inside seismic zone III.\nThe Kolkata metropolitan area is spread over and comprises 3 municipal corporations (including Kolkata Municipal Corporation), 39 local municipalities and 24 panchayat samitis, as of 2011 . The urban agglomeration encompassed 72 cities and 527 towns and villages, as of 2006 . Suburban areas in the Kolkata metropolitan area incorporate parts of the following districts: North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly, and Nadia. Kolkata, which is under the jurisdiction of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), has an area of . The east\u2013west dimension of the city is comparatively narrow, stretching from the Hooghly River in the west to roughly the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass in the east\u2014a span of . The north\u2013south distance is greater, and its axis is used to section the city into North, Central, and South Kolkata.\nNorth Kolkata is the oldest part of the city. Characterised by 19th-century architecture, dilapidated buildings, overpopulated slums, crowded bazaars and narrow alleyways, it includes areas such as Shyambazar, Hatibagan, Maniktala, Kankurgachi, Rajabazar, Shobhabazar, Shyampukur, Sonagachi, Kumortuli, Bagbazar, Jorasanko, Chitpur, Pathuriaghata, Cossipore, Sinthee, Belgachia, Jorabagan, and Dum Dum. The northern suburban areas like Baranagar, Noapara, Dunlop, Dakshineswar, Nagerbazar, Belghoria, Sodepur, Madhyamgram, Kestopur, Birati, Khardah up to Barrackpur are also within the city of Kolkata (as a metropolitan structure).\nCentral Kolkata hosts the central business district. It contains B. B. D. Bagh, formerly known as Dalhousie Square, and the Esplanade on its east; Strand Road is on its west. The West Bengal Secretariat, General Post Office, Reserve Bank of India, High Court, Lalbazar Police Headquarters, and several other government and private offices are located there. Another business hub is the area south of Park Street, which comprises thoroughfares such as Jawaharlal Nehru Road, Camac Street, Wood Street, Loudon Street, Shakespeare Sarani, and A. J. C. Bose Road. The Maidan is a large open field in the heart of the city that has been called the \"lungs of Kolkata\" and accommodates sporting events and public meetings. The Victoria Memorial and Kolkata Race Course are located at the southern end of the Maidan. Other important areas of Central Kolkata are Burrabazar, College Street, Sealdah, Taltala, Janbazar, Bowbazar, Entally, Chandni Chowk, Lalbazar, Chowringhee, Dharmatala, Tiretta Bazar, Bow Barracks, Mullick Bazar, Park Circus, Babughat etc. Among the other parks are Central Park in Bidhannagar and Millennium Park on Strand Road, along the Hooghly River.\nEast Kolkata is largely composed of newly developed areas and neighbourhoods of Saltlake, Rajarhat, Tangra, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Phoolbagan etc.\nTwo planned townships in the greater Kolkata region are Bidhannagar, also known as Salt Lake City and located north-east of the city; and Rajarhat, also called New Town and sited east of Bidhannagar. In the 2000s, Sector V in Bidhannagar developed into a business hub for information technology and telecommunication companies. Both Bidhannagar and New Town are situated outside the Kolkata Municipal Corporation limits, in their own municipalities.\nSouth Kolkata developed after India gained independence in 1947; it includes upscale neighbourhoods such as Ballygunge, Alipore, New Alipore, Lansdowne, Bhowanipore, Kalighat, Dhakuria, Gariahat, Tollygunge, Naktala, Jodhpur Park, Lake Gardens, Golf Green, Jadavpur, Haltu, Nandi Bagan, Picnic Garden, Topsia, Santoshpur and Kasba. Outlying areas of South Kolkata include Garden Reach, Khidirpur, Metiabruz, Taratala, Maheshtala, Budge Budge, Behala, Sarsuna, Barisha, Parnasree Pally, Thakurpukur, Kudghat, Ranikuthi, Bansdroni, Baghajatin, Tiljala and Garia. The southern suburban areas like Narendrapur, Sonarpur, Baruipur are also within the city of Kolkata (as metropolitan structure). Fort William, on the western part of the city, houses the headquarters of the Eastern Command of the Indian Army; its premises are under the jurisdiction of the army.\nKolkata is subject to a tropical wet-and-dry climate that is designated Aw under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. According to a United Nations Development Programme report, its wind and cyclone zone is \"very high damage risk\".\nThe annual mean temperature is ; monthly mean temperatures are . Summers (March\u2013June) are hot and humid, with temperatures in the low 30s Celsius; during dry spells, maximum temperatures often exceed 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) in May and June. Winter lasts for roughly two-and-a-half months, with seasonal lows dipping to in December and January. May is the hottest month, with daily temperatures ranging from ; January, the coldest month, has temperatures varying from . The highest recorded temperature is , and the lowest is . The winter is mild and very comfortable weather pertains over the city throughout this season.\nOften, in April\u2013June, the city is struck by heavy rains or dusty squalls that are followed by thunderstorms or hailstorms, bringing cooling relief from the prevailing humidity. These thunderstorms are convective in nature, and are known locally as kal b\u00f4ishakhi ( ), or \"Nor'westers\" in English.\nRains brought by the Bay of Bengal branch of the south-west summer monsoon lash Kolkata between June and September, supplying it with most of its annual rainfall of . The highest monthly rainfall total occurs in July and August. The city receives 2,528 hours of sunshine per year, with maximum sunlight exposure occurring in March. Kolkata has been hit by several cyclones; these include systems occurring in 1737 and 1864 that killed thousands.\nPollution is a major concern in Kolkata. As of 2008, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide annual concentration were within the national ambient air quality standards of India, but respirable suspended particulate matter levels were high, and on an increasing trend for five consecutive years, causing smog and haze. Severe air pollution in the city has caused a rise in pollution-related respiratory ailments, such as lung cancer.\nKolkata is the main commercial and financial hub of East and North-East India and home to the Calcutta Stock Exchange. It is a major commercial and military port, and is the only city in eastern India to have an international airport. Once India's leading city, Kolkata experienced a steady economic decline in the decades following India's independence due to steep population increases and a rise in militant trade-unionism, which included frequent strikes that were backed by left-wing parties. From the 1960s to the late 1990s, several factories were closed and businesses relocated. The lack of capital and resources added to the depressed state of the city's economy and gave rise to an unwelcome sobriquet: the \"dying city\". The city's fortunes improved after the Indian economy was liberalised in the 1990s and changes in economic policy were enacted by the West Bengal state government.\nFlexible production has been the norm in Kolkata, which has an informal sector that employs more than 40% of the labour force. One unorganised group, roadside hawkers, generated business worth 8,772 crore ( 2 billion) in 2005. As of 2001, around 0.81% of the city's workforce was employed in the primary sector (agriculture, forestry, mining, etc.); 15.49% worked in the secondary sector (industrial and manufacturing); and 83.69% worked in the tertiary sector (service industries). As of 2003, the majority of households in slums were engaged in occupations belonging to the informal sector; 36.5% were involved in servicing the urban middle class (as maids, drivers, etc.), and 22.2% were casual labourers. About 34% of the available labour force in Kolkata slums were unemployed. According to one estimate, almost a quarter of the population live on less than 27 rupees (equivalent to 45 US cents) per day. As in many other Indian cities, information technology became a high-growth sector in Kolkata starting in the late 1990s; the city's IT sector grew at 70% per annum\u2014a rate that was twice the national average. The 2000s saw a surge of investments in the real estate, infrastructure, retail, and hospitality sectors; several large shopping malls and hotels were launched. As of 2010, Kolkata, with an estimated gross domestic product (GDP) by purchasing power parity of 150 billion dollars, ranked third among South Asian cities, after Mumbai and Delhi. Kolkata's GDP in 2014 was Rs 1.84 trillion, according to a collaborative assessment by multiple universities and climate agencies.\nKolkata is home to many industrial units operated by large public- and private-sector corporations; major sectors include steel, heavy engineering, mining, minerals, cement, pharmaceuticals, food processing, agriculture, electronics, textiles, and jute. ITC Limited, Coal India Limited, National Insurance Company, Exide Industries and Britannia Industries rank among the companies headquartered in the city. The Tea Board of India and the Ordnance Factories Board of the Ministry of Defence are also headquartered in the city. Kolkata hosts the headquarters of three major public-sector banks: Allahabad Bank, UCO Bank, and the United Bank of India. Adoption of the \"Look East\" policy by the Indian government; opening of Sikkim's Nathu La mountain pass, which is located on the border between India and China, to bi-directional international trade; and the interest shown by South-East Asian countries in expanding into Indian markets are factors that could benefit Kolkata.\nThe demonym for residents of Kolkata are Calcuttan and Kolkatan. According to provisional results of the 2011 national census, Kolkata district, which occupies an area of , had a population of\n4,486,679; its population density was . This represents a decline of 1.88% during the decade 2001\u201311. The sex ratio is 899 females per 1000 males\u2014lower than the national average. The ratio is depressed by the influx of working males from surrounding rural areas, from the rest of West Bengal; these men commonly leave their families behind. Kolkata's literacy rate of 87.14% exceeds the all-India average of 74%. The final population totals of census 2011 stated the population of city as 4,496,694. The urban agglomeration had a population of 14,112,536 in 2011.\nBengali Hindus form the majority of Kolkata's population; Marwaris, Biharis and Muslims compose large minorities. Among Kolkata's smaller communities are Chinese, Tamils, Nepalis, Odias, Telugus, Assamese, Gujaratis, Anglo-Indians, Armenians, Greeks, Tibetans, Maharashtrians, Konkanis, Malayalees, Punjabis, and Parsis. The number of Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other foreign-origin groups declined during the 20th century. The Jewish population of Kolkata was 5,000 during World War II, but declined after Indian independence and the establishment of Israel; by 2013, there were 25 Jews in the city. India's sole Chinatown is in eastern Kolkata; once home to 20,000 ethnic Chinese, its population dropped to around 2,000 as of 2009 as a result of multiple factors including repatriation and denial of Indian citizenship following the 1962 Sino-Indian War, and immigration to foreign countries for better economic opportunities. The Chinese community traditionally worked in the local tanning industry and ran Chinese restaurants.\nBengali, the official state language, is the dominant language in Kolkata. English is also used, particularly by the white-collar workforce. Hindi and Urdu are spoken by a sizeable minority. According to the 2011 census, 76.51% of the population is Hindu, 20.60% Muslim, 0.88% Christian, and 0.47% Jain. The remainder of the population includes Sikhs, Buddhists, and other religions which accounts for 0.45% of the population; 1.09% did not state a religion in the census. Kolkata reported 67.6% of Special and Local Laws crimes registered in 35 large Indian cities during 2004. The Kolkata police district registered 15,510 Indian Penal Code cases in 2010, the 8th-highest total in the country. In 2010, the crime rate was 117.3 per 100,000, below the national rate of 187.6; it was the lowest rate among India's largest cities.\nAs of 2003, about one-third of the population, or 1.5 million people, lived in 3,500 unregistered squatter-occupied and 2,011 registered slums. The authorised slums (with access to basic services like water, latrines, trash removal by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation) can be broadly divided into two groups\u2014bustees, in which slum dwellers have some long term tenancy agreement with the landowners; and udbastu colonies, settlements which had been leased to refugees from present-day Bangladesh by the Government. The unauthorised slums (devoid of basic services provided by the municipality) are occupied by squatters who started living on encroached lands\u2014mainly along canals, railway lines and roads. According to the 2005 National Family Health Survey, around 14% of the households in Kolkata were poor, while 33% lived in slums, indicating a substantial proportion of households in slum areas were better off economically than the bottom quarter of urban households in terms of wealth status. Mother Teresa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for founding and working with the Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata\u2014an organisation \"whose primary task was to love and care for those persons nobody was prepared to look after\".\nKolkata is administered by several government agencies. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation, or KMC, oversees and manages the civic infrastructure of the city's 15 boroughs, which together encompass 141 wards. Each ward elects a councillor to the KMC. Each borough has a committee of councillors, each of whom is elected to represent a ward. By means of the borough committees, the corporation undertakes urban planning and maintains roads, government-aided schools, hospitals, and municipal markets. As Kolkata's apex body, the corporation discharges its functions through the mayor-in-council, which comprises a mayor, a deputy mayor, and ten other elected members of the KMC. The functions of the KMC include water supply, drainage and sewerage, sanitation, solid waste management, street lighting, and building regulation.\nThe Kolkata Municipal Corporation was ranked 1st out of 21 Cities for best governance & administrative practices in India in 2014. It scored 4.0 on 10 compared to the national average of 3.3.\nThe Kolkata Port Trust, an agency of the central government, manages the city's river port. As of 2012, the All India Trinamool Congress controls the KMC; the mayor is Sovan Chatterjee, while the deputy mayor is Farzana Alam. The city has an apolitical titular post, that of the Sheriff of Kolkata, which presides over various city-related functions and conferences.\nKolkata's administrative agencies have areas of jurisdiction that do not coincide. Listed in ascending order by area, they are: Kolkata district; the Kolkata Police area and the Kolkata Municipal Corporation area, or \"Kolkata city\"; and the Kolkata metropolitan area, which is the city's urban agglomeration. The agency overseeing the latter, the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority, is responsible for the statutory planning and development of greater Kolkata.\nAs the seat of the Government of West Bengal, Kolkata is home to not only the offices of the local governing agencies, but also the West Bengal Legislative Assembly; the state secretariat, which is housed in the Writers' Building; and the Calcutta High Court. Most government establishments and institutions are housed in the centre of the city in B. B. D. Bagh (formerly known as Dalhousie Square). The Calcutta High Court is the oldest High Court in India. It was preceded by the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William which was established in 1774. The Calcutta High Court has jurisdiction over the state of West Bengal and the Union Territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Kolkata has lower courts: the Court of Small Causes and the City Civil Court decide civil matters; the Sessions Court rules in criminal cases. The Kolkata Police, headed by a police commissioner, is overseen by the West Bengal Ministry of Home Affairs. The Kolkata district elects two representatives to India's lower house, the Lok Sabha, and 11 representatives to the state legislative assembly.\nThe Kolkata Municipal Corporation supplies the city with potable water that is sourced from the Hooghly River; most of it is treated and purified at the Palta pumping station located in North 24 Parganas district. Roughly 95% of the 4,000 tonnes of refuse produced daily by the city is transported to the dumping grounds in Dhapa, which is east of the town. To promote the recycling of garbage and sewer water, agriculture in encouraged on the dumping grounds. Parts of the city lack proper sewerage, leading to unsanitary methods of waste disposal.\nElectricity is supplied by the privately operated Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation, or CESC, to the city proper; the West Bengal State Electricity Board supplies it in the suburbs. Fire services are handled by the West Bengal Fire Service, a state agency. As of 2012, the city had 16 fire stations.\nState-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, or BSNL, as well as private enterprises, among them Vodafone, Bharti Airtel, Reliance, Idea Cellular, Aircel, Tata DoCoMo, Tata Teleservices, Virgin Mobile, and MTS India, are the leading telephone and cell phone service providers in the city. Kolkata being the first city in India to have cell phone and 4G connectivity, the GSM and CDMA cellular coverage is extensive. As of 2010, Kolkata has 7 percent of the total Broadband internet consumers in India; BSNL, VSNL, Tata Indicom, Sify, Airtel, and Reliance are among the main vendors.\nThe Ordnance Factories Board of the Ministry of Defence, the Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers and the Eastern Command of the Indian Army are all headquartered in the city. The U.S Consulate in Calcutta is the US Department of State's second oldest Consulate and dates from 19 November 1792. The Consulate General serves the states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.\nPublic transport is provided by the Kolkata Suburban Railway, the Kolkata Metro, trams, and buses. The suburban rail network reaches the city's distant suburbs.\nAccording to a 2013 survey conducted by International Association of Public Transport, Kolkata ranks the top among the six cities surveyed in India, in terms of public transport system. The Kolkata Metro, in operation since 1984, is the oldest underground mass transit system in India. It spans the north\u2013south length of the city and covers a distance of . As of 2009, five Metro rail lines were under construction. Kolkata has four long-distance railway stations, located at Howrah (the largest railway complex in India), Sealdah, Chitpur and Shalimar, which connect Kolkata by rail to most cities in West Bengal and to other major cities in India. The city serves as the headquarters of three railway Zone out of Seventeen of the Indian Railways regional divisions\u2014the Kolkata Metro Railways, Eastern Railway and the South-Eastern Railway.\nKolkata has rail and road connectivity with Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh.\nBuses, which are the most commonly used mode of transport, are run by government agencies and private operators. Kolkata is the only Indian city with a tram network, which is operated by the Calcutta Tramways Company. The slow-moving tram services are restricted to certain areas of the city. Water-logging, caused by heavy rains that fall during the summer monsoon, can interrupt transportation networks. Hired public conveyances include auto rickshaws, which often ply specific routes, and yellow metered taxis. Almost all of Kolkata's taxis are antiquated Hindustan Ambassadors by make; newer air-conditioned radio taxis are in service as well. In parts of the city, cycle rickshaws and hand-pulled rickshaws are patronised by the public for short trips.\nDue to its diverse and abundant public transportation, privately owned vehicles are not as common in Kolkata as in other major Indian cities. The city has witnessed a steady increase in the number of registered vehicles; 2002 data showed an increase of 44% over a period of seven years. As of 2004, after adjusting for population density, the city's \"road space\" was only 6% compared to 23% in Delhi and 17% in Mumbai. The Kolkata Metro has somewhat eased traffic congestion, as has the addition of new roads and flyovers. Agencies operating long-distance bus services include Calcutta State Transport Corporation, South Bengal State Transport Corporation, North Bengal State Transport Corporation, and various private operators. The city's main bus terminals are located at Esplanade and Babughat. The Kolkata\u2013Delhi and Kolkata\u2013Chennai prongs of the Golden Quadrilateral, and National Highway 34 start from the city.\nNetaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport, located in Dum Dum some north-east of the city centre, operates domestic and international flights. In 2013, the airport was upgraded to handle increased air traffic.\nThe Port of Kolkata, established in 1870, is India's oldest and the only major river port. The Kolkata Port Trust manages docks in Kolkata and Haldia. The port hosts passenger services to Port Blair, capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands; freighter service to ports throughout India and around the world is operated by the Shipping Corporation of India. Ferry services connect Kolkata with its twin city of Howrah, located across the Hooghly River.\nThe road transport is going to take a step further for passengers travelling by bus.By this year April rocket buses along with bio-toilet for the route North Bengal to Kolkata is going to get introduced.\nAs of 2011, the health care system in Kolkata consists of 48 government hospitals, mostly under the Department of Health & Family Welfare, Government of West Bengal, and 366 private medical establishments; these establishments provide the city with 27,687 hospital beds. For every 10,000 people in the city, there are 61.7 hospital beds, which is higher than the national average of 9 hospital beds per 10,000. Ten medical and dental colleges are located in the Kolkata metropolitan area which act as tertiary referral hospitals in the state. Calcutta Medical College, founded in 1835, was the first institution in Asia to teach modern medicine. These facilities are inadequate to meet the healthcare needs of the city. More than 78% in Kolkata prefer the private medical sector over the public medical sector, due to the poor quality of care, the lack of a nearby facility, and excessive waiting times at government facilities. \nAccording to the 2005 National Family Health Survey, only a small proportion of Kolkata households were covered under any health scheme or health insurance. The total fertility rate in Kolkata was 1.4, which was the lowest among the eight cities surveyed. In Kolkata, 77% of the married women used contraceptives, which was the highest among the cities surveyed, but use of modern contraceptive methods was the lowest (46%). The infant mortality rate in Kolkata was 41 per 1,000 live births, and the mortality rate for children under five was 49 per 1,000 live births. \nAmong the surveyed cities, Kolkata stood second (5%) for children who had not had any vaccinations under the Universal Immunization Programme as of 2005 . Kolkata ranked second among the surveyed cities, with access to an anganwadi centre under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme for 57% of the children between 0 and 71 months. The proportion of malnourished, anaemic and underweight children in Kolkata was less in comparison to other surveyed cities. \nAbout 18% of the men and 30% of the women in Kolkata are obese\u2014the majority of them belonging to the non-poor strata of society. In 2005, Kolkata had the highest percentage (55%) among the surveyed cities of anaemic woman, while 20% of the men in Kolkata were anaemic. Diseases like diabetes, asthma, goitre and other thyroid disorders were found in large numbers of people. Tropical diseases like malaria, dengue and chikungunya are prevalent in Kolkata, though their incidence is decreasing. Kolkata is one of the districts in India with a high number of people with AIDS; it has been designated a district prone to high risk.\nBecause of higher air pollution, the life expectancy of a person born in the city in 2014, is four years fewer than in the suburbs.\nKolkata's schools are run by the state government or private organisations, many of which are religious. Bengali and English are the primary languages of instruction; Urdu and Hindi are also used, particularly in central Kolkata. Schools in Kolkata follow the \"10+2+3\" plan. After completing their secondary education, students typically enroll in schools that have a higher secondary facility and are affiliated with the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education, the ICSE, or the CBSE. They usually choose a focus on liberal arts, business, or science. Vocational programs are also available. Some Kolkata schools, for example La Martiniere Calcutta, Calcutta Boys' School, St. James' School (Kolkata), St. Xavier's Collegiate School, and Loreto House, have been ranked amongst the best schools in the country. As of 2010, the Kolkata urban agglomeration is home to 14 universities run by the state government. The colleges are each affiliated with a university or institution based either in Kolkata or elsewhere in India. Aliah University which was founded in 1780 as Mohammedan College of Calcutta is the oldest post-secondary educational institution of the city. The University of Calcutta, founded in 1857, is the first modern university in South Asia. Bengal Engineering and Science University (BESU) is the second oldest engineering institution of the country located in Howrah. An Institute of National Importance, BESU was converted to India's first IIEST. Jadavpur University is known for its arts, science, and engineering faculties. The Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, which was the first of the Indian Institutes of Management, was established in 1961 at Joka, a locality in the south-western suburbs. Kolkata also houses the prestigious Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, which was started here in the year 2006. The West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences is one of India's autonomous law schools, and the Indian Statistical Institute is a public research institute and university. Private institutions include the University of Engineering & Management (UEM).\nNotable scholars who were born, worked or studied in Kolkata include physicists Satyendra Nath Bose, Meghnad Saha, and Jagadish Chandra Bose; chemist Prafulla Chandra Roy; statisticians Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis and Anil Kumar Gain; physician Upendranath Brahmachari; educator Ashutosh Mukherjee; and Nobel laureates Rabindranath Tagore, C. V. Raman, and Amartya Sen.\nKolkata houses many premier research institutes like Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB), Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Bose Institute, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP), All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute (CGCRI), S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences (SNBNCBS), Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management (IISWBM), National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Kolkata, Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC) and Indian Centre for Space Physics. Nobel laureate Sir C. V. Raman did his groundbreaking work in Raman effect in IACS.\nKolkata is known for its literary, artistic, and revolutionary heritage; as the former capital of India, it was the birthplace of modern Indian literary and artistic thought. Kolkata has been called the \"City of Furious, Creative Energy\" as well as the \"cultural [or literary] capital of India\". The presence of paras, which are neighbourhoods that possess a strong sense of community, is characteristic of the city. Typically, each para has its own community club and, on occasion, a playing field. Residents engage in addas, or leisurely chats, that often take the form of freestyle intellectual conversation. The city has a tradition of political graffiti depicting everything from outrageous slander to witty banter and limericks, caricatures, and propaganda.\nKolkata has many buildings adorned with Indo-Islamic and Indo-Saracenic architectural motifs. Several well-maintained major buildings from the colonial period have been declared \"heritage structures\"; others are in various stages of decay. Established in 1814 as the nation's oldest museum, the Indian Museum houses large collections that showcase Indian natural history and Indian art. Marble Palace is a classic example of a European mansion that was built in the city. The Victoria Memorial, a place of interest in Kolkata, has a museum documenting the city's history. The National Library of India is the leading public library in the country while Science City is the largest science centre in the Indian subcontinent.\nThe popularity of commercial theatres in the city has declined since the 1980s. Group theatres of Kolkata, a cultural movement that started in the 1940s contrasting with the then-popular commercial theatres, are theatres that are not professional or commercial, and are centres of various experiments in theme, content, and production; group theatres use the proscenium stage to highlight socially relevant messages. Chitpur locality of the city houses multiple production companies of jatra, a tradition of folk drama popular in rural Bengal. Kolkata is the home of the Bengali cinema industry, dubbed \"Tollywood\" for Tollygunj, where most of the state's film studios are located. Its long tradition of art films includes globally acclaimed film directors such as Academy Award-winning director Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Mrinal Sen, Tapan Sinha, and contemporary directors such as Aparna Sen, Buddhadeb Dasgupta, Goutam Ghose and Rituparno Ghosh.\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, Bengali literature was modernised through the works of authors such as Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Michael Madhusudan Dutt, Rabindranath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam, and Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay. Coupled with social reforms led by Ram Mohan Roy, Swami Vivekananda, and others, this constituted a major part of the Bengal Renaissance. The middle and latter parts of the 20th century witnessed the arrival of post-modernism, as well as literary movements such as those espoused by the Kallol movement, hungryalists and the little magazines. Large majority of publishers of the city is concentrated in and around College Street, \"... a half-mile of bookshops and bookstalls spilling over onto the pavement\", selling new and used books.\nKalighat painting originated in 19th century Kolkata as a local style that reflected a variety of themes including mythology and quotidian life. The Government College of Art and Craft, founded in 1864, has been the cradle as well as workplace of eminent artists including Abanindranath Tagore, Jamini Roy, and Nandalal Bose. The art college was the birthplace of the Bengal school of art that arose as an avant garde and nationalist movement reacting against the prevalent academic art styles in the early 20th century. The Academy of Fine Arts and other art galleries hold regular art exhibitions. The city is recognised for its appreciation of Rabindra sangeet (songs written by Rabindranath Tagore) and Indian classical music, with important concerts and recitals, such as Dover Lane Music Conference, being held throughout the year; Bengali popular music, including baul folk ballads, kirtans, and Gajan festival music; and modern music, including Bengali-language adhunik songs. Since the early 1990s, new genres have emerged, including one comprising alternative folk\u2013rock Bengali bands. Another new style, jibonmukhi gaan (\"songs about life\"), is based on realism.

The of land was granted to Jacob Chamber by the state of South Carolina in 1786. Daniel Carter later purchased the property and it was once again sold to William Singleton in 1790. This was where the name Singleton's Crossroads originated.\nThe tavern owned by Singleton and his wife sat at the intersection of what was once known as Mecklenburg Road, now named Church Street, and McCallum Ferry Road, now known as Main Street. During that time, the tavern was a stopping place for the stagecoach between Georgetown and Charlotte. (Now this intersection involves Highway 15, which at one point was the premier north\u2013south route from New York to Miami.) In 1798, William Singleton died, leaving his wife the owner of the tavern until her death in 1820. One year later the land was sold to Bishop. During this time period the area around present-day Bishopville was said to be composed of mostly wilderness, with only a few scattered, primitive houses.\nAlthough voting for the creation of Lee County and for making Bishopville its county seat occurred in 1892, there was a delay in enacting these votes until February 1902, when it was ruled that Bishopville had met all requirements to be a county seat. This led to the marking of county boundaries, which were along Lynches River, Black River, Scape Ore Swamp, Sparrow Swamp, Long Branch, and Screeches Branch, as well as the development of a courthouse and jail. As surveyed in the parent counties, the main limits followed old roads and artificial limits.\nIt was not until December 15, 1902 that Bishopville received news of its success. To celebrate, the town hosted speeches and the shooting of the old cannon repeatedly. This cannon is located on the concrete base in front of Lee County\u2019s Courthouse in Bishopville.\nLee County has historically been a leader in cotton production in the state and is the home of the South Carolina Cotton Museum.\nIn addition to the Lee County Courthouse, the Ashwood School Gymnasium and Auditorium, Bishopville Commercial Historic District, Bishopville High School, James Carnes House, Dennis High School, Thomas Fraser House, William Apollos James House, The Manor, Mt. Zion Presbyterian Church, William Rogers House, South Main Historic District, Spencer House, and Tall Oaks are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThis town is known for the alleged sightings of a reptile-like monster, known as \"The Lizard Man\", near a swamp called Scape Ore Swamp. It has supposedly frightened people and damaged some cars. At one point there was a one million dollar reward for anyone who could find and present \"Lizard Man\".\nPearl Fryar's Topiary Garden is the home to one of the most breath-taking attractions in South Carolina. Located at 145 Broad Acres Road in Bishopville, South Carolina, this garden is visited annually by many tourists. Fryar and his carefully sculptured topiary garden has been featured many times on television specials and in dozens of magazines.

The population was 702 at the 2000 census. Although it was a railroad town as early as 1847, it was not officially chartered until August 19, 1907.\n", "text": "In 1857 the Savannah, Albany and Gulf Railroad Company's line from Savannah, Georgia to Screven (then known as Station Seven) was completed when then trestle was built over the Altamaha River at Doctortown. Prior to this, the tracks connected the town to Thomasville, then a popular resort destination for wealthy Northerners and Europeans. The town was named for Dr. James Proctor Screven of the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad. After Dr. Screven's death in 1859, his son John Bryan Screven took over the railroad and continued its development. Both men served as mayor of Savannah. A section of the tracks just outside Screven on the Little Satilla is still known as the Abutment, the name it was given during the construction of the tracks.\nThe town was originally in the 4th land District of Appling County and moved into Wayne County when the county lines were redrawn after the American Civil War ended. The Confederate States Army had a training camp, Camp Harrison, in Screven for a short time in the Fall of 1860. The soldiers came by train to Screven.\nFollowing the Civil War, Captain Christopher Columbus Grace, one of the Immortal 600, came to Screven and established himself in the turpentine, ginning and trade store business. In 1877, he erected a sawmill that spurned the community's growth. In 1880, he was a founding member of the Screven Methodist Episcopal Church, the first church established in the town of Screven. Other men of commerce came to join Captain Grace in the town of Screven. J. A. Hilton building the community's first brick store and operated a hardware store in later years. The J. H. Walker Company opened a mercantile business in 1876 and J. C. Hatcher opened a store in 1899. In the mid-1890s, the Royal family relocated to Screven to work with the Atlantic Coastline Railroad.\nRailroad history was made on Screven's tracks in March 1901 in an event that still holds forth in railroad lore. The Spanish\u2013American War had ended, but occupation troops were to remain in Cuba until 1902. Post Office Department officials, realizing the need for faster mail service, had begun drawing up a contract to award to either the Plant System (then known as the Savannah, Florida and Western) or the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, both of which operated south of the ACL termination point of Charleston, South Carolina. The Havana mail would depart from Jacksonville. Actually, Seaboard was favored because of her more direct route. The Plant Road detoured over 30 miles from Savannah to Waycross then to Jacksonville. And it was Jacksonville where the steam packet to Havana waited to load the mail. Both trains left Union Station in Savannah at 3:00 a.m. The SF&W's route was a longer one since it traveled through Jesup, Screven, and Waycross before cutting over southwest to Folkston to travel on to Jacksonville. Twelve miles out of Savannah, the SF&W\u2019s engines ran hot. After one attempt at repairing the engine failed, Engineer Albert Lodge made the decision to switch engines and start again making it from Fleming to Jesup in less than 33 minutes. Knowing he must make up an hour of time if they were to have a shot at the mail contract, Lodge ripped out of Jesup on Number 111 and made 11 miles in 9 minutes. More speed was added and the train traveled five miles in two and a half minutes \u2013 she was traveling at 120 miles per hour when she passed through the town of Screven and approached the Little Satilla Bridge. Dispatcher D. S. McClellan is quoted as saying, \"I shall never forget the things that passed through my mind as this train reached the top of a little hill just south of Screven and started slowing down for the fill for the Satilla River. There is a little curve just after passing over the river, and I wondered if the engine were going to take that curve or if it were going to take to the woods.\" When the train came into Waycross, the crew figured they had come the 40 miles from Jesup in 28 minutes. The stop in Waycross completed, the train headed south to Racepond and arrived in Folkston in 25 minutes. Engine 111 arrived in Jacksonville at 6:31. The men had traveled faster than any other and their record would stay unequaled until 1934; to date, it has never been beaten.\nCountry schools dotted the landscape in and around Screven and the present school building is used for grades pre-k through five. The school was relocated to this location from an area around the old Screven fire department in the early 1920s. The upper building housing the pre-kindergarten classes and the office suite were built in 1922. A Works Progress Administration construction crew constructed the auditorium and middle building as a part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal legislation in 1936\u20131937 when P. D. Griffis was the chairman of the Screven Board of Education. This same WPA crew built the Jesup Post Office (now Jesup City Hall) and the Odum Elementary School gym and high school building. Consolidation of schools in 1966 marks the beginning of the decline in population in Screven. W.L.(Bill) Bohler was made principal of the school in 1966 and saw the school transition from a high school to an elementary and middle school(grades 1\u20137)and remained principal until 1972. His wife, Dorothy, was the school's math teacher for many years and was known for her progressive thinking and teaching methods. Their only son, J. David Bohler, went on to become a nationally recognized physician and scholar in South Carolina and has been quoted as saying \"If not for growing up in Screven, I wouldn't be where I am today. I'm the best educated Redneck to ever come out of Georgia\". Dr. Bohler has also traveled the world as a big game hunter, taking trophies including the \"big five\" in Africa.\nScreven was once the largest town in the county because of its association with the railroad. Following the ACL's decision to locate Rice Yard in Waycross and Jesup's growth as the county seat, its population began to decline. The Grace family continued to play an important role in Screven. Captain Grace's grandson, Lindsay Grace, maintained an important presence in the town and contributed greatly to the county's economy through his business ventures. Mr. Grace helped to establish the Lake Grace recreational area between Screven and Odum. Another member of the Grace family, Robert Lindsay Thomas, a Screven farmer, served in the United States House of Representatives from 1982 to 1992 and later served on the 1996 Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games.\nIn March 2005, Screven was hit by a tornado, causing the uprooting of trees, damaged homes and stores in the downtown area, and devastated Screven Cabinets into a pile of sheet metal and insulation. No one was killed, but some were trapped in their homes and businesses.\nScreven is home to a former National Champion Turkey Oak tree but the tree sustained damage in a storm and is no longer the champion. The tree is located on property belonging to the Screven United Methodist Church on School Street in Screven. Screven is also home to the Southern Pride Agriculture Ride, a bike ride that starts and ends at Grace Community Center and the home of the Screven Ghost Light, a bouncing orb of light seen for over a century at the railroad crossing on Bennett Road. Those who have seen the light say it moves back and forth and glows bright and then dim. It reportedly is seen after rain and after a train has gone by. Bennett Road is located 4 miles out of Screven on Hwy 84 East.\nThe town celebrated its centennial in mid-2007 during the town's July 4 observance and with a community celebration on August 19.\nScreven is located at (31.485008, \u221282.016305).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 702 people, 291 households, and 196 families residing in the city.

Both it and Clinton County, Missouri were named for George Clinton, one of the Founding Fathers, the first governor of New York, and vice president from 1805 to 1812.\nThe area was settled chiefly by migrants from the Upper South, especially Kentucky and western Virginia, and was near what was called \"Little Dixie\" in Missouri. They brought their slaves and culture with them. For a brief period of time during the 1830s, Plattsburg was home to a Federal land office for areas of northern Missouri that were newly opened to settlement by European Americans after the Platte Purchase in 1836. Until then, Plattsburg was one of the farthest western non-military settlements.\nThe area became a leading producer of both hemp and tobacco, both major products of the Bluegrass Region of Kentucky and dependent on slave labor. David Rice Atchison, the US senator from here, was pro-slavery. As the county seat, Plattsburg was a center of trade and politics, with a variety of retail stores and professions.

It was named after North Carolina legislator, Willie Jones, who had supported the state's westward expansion across the Appalachian Mountains.\nThe town was renamed \"Jonesboro\" for a period of time, but it has been changed back to the original spelling.\nJonesborough was originally a part of the Washington District. In 1784, it became the capital of the autonomous State of Franklin (ostensibly named after American founding father, Benjamin Franklin). Congress, however, never recognized Franklin, which was re-claimed by North Carolina in late 1788.\nJonesborough is often considered to be the center of the abolitionist movement within the states that would join the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Elihu Embree printed his publication, The Emancipator, from Jonesborough. Publication began in 1820, making The Emancipator the first American periodical to be dedicated exclusively to the issue of the abolition of slavery. While Tennessee would later join the Confederacy, most east Tennesseans had Unionist leanings. They were generally subsistence farmers and held relatively few slaves compared to landowners in Middle Tennessee or the plantation areas of the Delta near the Mississippi River.\nIn the 1840s, Jonesborough became the second hometown to the Jonesborough Whig, a newspaper published by William G. \"Parson\" Brownlow, after Brownlow relocated the paper from Elizabethton, Tennessee, where it had been in publication for approximately two years. Brownlow and rival editor/Methodist circuit rider Landon Carter Haynes brawled in the streets of Jonesborough in May 1840. Over the next several years, the two newspapermen bashed one another in their respective papers, each managing at times to thwart the other's political ambitions. Haynes left the newspaper business in 1845, and Brownlow, who later was elected as governor, moved the Whig to Knoxville in 1849.\nToday, Jonesborough attracts heritage tourism because of its historical status as Tennessee's oldest town and its significant historic preservation efforts that have preserved a rich architectural fabric. The town's museum describes the local heritage of tobacco farming. The historic Chester Inn, built in 1797, still stands in downtown Jonesborough. The Jonesborough Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. The oldest surviving building, the Christopher Taylor House (built in 1777 about a mile outside of the original town limits), was relocated to a lot within the historic district.\nJonesborough is the home to the International Storytelling Center, which holds the annual National Storytelling Festival on the first full weekend in October. The Festival builds on the Appalachian cultural tradition of storytelling, and has been drawing people from around the world for more than 35 years. Large tents are pitched in parks around town, and storytellers sit on stages or at the head of the main tent to perform. Occasionally, performances are interrupted for a moment by passing Norfolk Southern Railway trains. Past storytellers included Carmen Agra Deedy, Syd Lieberman, and Kathryn Tucker Windham. The festival inspired the development of a successful storytelling graduate degree program at the nearby East Tennessee State University.\nJonesborough is situated in an area where the watershed of the Watauga River meets the watershed of the Nolichucky River. The Watauga passes approximately to the northeast of Jonesborough, and the Nolichucky passes roughly to the southwest. The town's principle stream, Little Limestone Creek, is part of the Nolichucky watershed.\nJonesborough is surrounded by low hills and elongated ridges that are characteristic of the Appalachian Ridge-and-Valley Province. The main crest of the Appalachian Mountains rises just a few miles southeast of Jonesborough.\nJonesborough is centered on the junction of Andrew Johnson Highway (which is part of both U.S. Route 321 and U.S. Route 11), which connects the town to Greeneville to the southwest and Johnson City to the northeast, and State Route 81, which connects Jonesborough to Interstate 81 to the northwest and Interstate 26 at Erwin to the southeast.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 4,168 people, 1,660 households, and 1,107 families residing in the town.

During this time, he lodged in a cabin belonging to Major Christopher Taylor, which was located about a mile outside of town. In 1974, this cabin was removed from its original spot and reconstructed in the town's park. The ghost supposedly walks up to the front door and disappears into the building. The ghost has also been reportedly seen walking down the street, in the direction of the old courthouse.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 2028, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2028, "length": 1386, "sectionHeading": "History | Modern tourism", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3414, "length": 992, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4406, "length": 1612, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6018, "length": 309, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6327, "length": 459, "sectionHeading": "Recreation", "sectionLabel": "city.recreation"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6786, "length": 629, "sectionHeading": "Local legends", "sectionLabel": "city.other"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynch,_Kentucky", "type": "city", "title": "Lynch, Kentucky", "abstract": "Lynch is a home rule-class city in Harlan County, Kentucky, in the United States.

In 1856, a tornado swept through the town killing nine people and destroying most of its buildings. The seat of the county was moved to Dallas not long after.\n", "text": "Cedar Hill was founded around 1846 by a small group of settlers from the Peters Colony.

Among the survivors was teacher and pastor, Robert Crawford. Crawford donated four acres of his land to church trustees to be designated as a free and indiscriminate public graveyard. Nine victims of the tornado were buried on Crawford\u2019s land.\nThe graveyard lay lost for about 100 years. It was rediscovered and certified by the Texas Historical Commission in 2006, and was named the Crawford Tornado Graveyard. The graveyard was reconsecrated in a blessing ceremony on October 7, 2011.

After taking the money, he locked the employees in the vault and made his getaway. When Hamilton got wind of reports that some of the cash had been hidden during the first robbery, he returned to rob the bank again.\nThe consecutive robberies took a toll on the bank, causing it to fall into financial ruin and ultimately close its doors for good.\nRaymond Hamilton was incarcerated at Eastham Prison in Lovelady, Texas on other charges when, on January 17, 1934, his partners, Bonnie and Clyde, broke him out of jail. The gang is known to have had an old hide out on the south edge of Cedar Hill and scattered places in the Mountain Creek Valley.\nHamilton was later re-captured on April 24, 1934, after robbing a bank in nearby Lewisville, Texas. The building where the robbery took place still stands in Historic Downtown Cedar Hill. It is the current home of Cedar Hill Barbers. In March 2008, the building was designated as a historic resource by the City of Cedar Hill and bears an official medallion indicating its significance.\nCedar Hill is located at (32.588454, -96.947325).

The school is private and is nestled in the hills and woods on the east side of Joe Pool Lake.\nIn the early 1990s, the population of Cedar Hill was increasing rapidly and citizens began to be concerned about the need for orderly economic development. An economic development advisory committee was formed by the city council that surveyed the residents to see how they envisioned Cedar Hill's future. Based on the response, subcommittees were formed to look into funding, asset enhancement, and community image.\nIn January 1994 voters approved a special sales tax to fund the economic development efforts, and the Cedar Hill EDC was incorporated in September 1994. They began with an annual budget of $150,000, and have increased it to $3.5 million with their development efforts. The economic development corporation has been a huge proponent in development activity in the City, assisting with recruiting and retaining businesses.\nSince 2000, the city has added several retail outlets. The opening of The Plaza at Cedar Hill, in the fall of 2000, began the growth. This retail center included a variety of large and small stores, including Pier 1 Imports, Macaroni Grill, David's Seafood, Chili's, Hobby Lobby and OfficeMax. Sprouts Farmers Market opened a new store in October 2009.\nLater that year, The Cedar Hill Crossing was built. The retail area includes anchors Home Depot, Kohl's and Staples. A few years later, in 2003, Cedar Village, , was built to include linking a new city hall and historic Main Street district to retail, residential, office and entertainment developments. The Village includes retail frontage along US Hwy 67, restaurants, office space, a stand-alone J. C.

A couple of years later, Cedar Hill Pointe was built, which opened in 2005, with Best Buy, Rooms to Go Beds, Wolf Camera and other retail stores.\nHillside Village (formerly Uptown Village at Cedar Hill), Cedar Hill's upscale lifestyle center, opened in March 2008. The lifestyle shopping center includes three anchor stores (Dillard's, Barnes & Noble, and Dick's Sporting Goods), 65 additional stores, and numerous restaurants. Some of the stores include Hollister Co., American Eagle Outfitters, Old Navy, Victoria's Secret, A\u00e9ropostale, Finish Line, Foot Locker, Champs Sports, Rue21, Charming Charlie, and GameStop. Some of the restaurants include Avocado California Roll & Sushi, Razoo's Cajun Cafe, and Grimaldi's Coal Brick-Oven Pizzeria. Hillside Village is bound by Highway 67 to the east, FM 1382 on the south, Pleasant Run Road on the north, and Cedar Hill Road on the west.\nThe Uptown Village development was awarded the 2006 Best Real Estate Deal in Retail/Hospitality by Dallas Business Journal.\nTrademark Property Co. acquired the Uptown Village property in 2015 which brought multimillion-dollar renovations including first phase: new children's play area, new promenade section with a bocce ball court, a covered stage area, and enhanced outdoor elements to increase the shopping experience at the lifestyle center. The new name and corresponding new brand were selected to reflect the garden-like look and feel planned in the multimillion-dollar property renovation as well as paying homage to the community in which it lies. The center now includes new tenants H&M and Grimaldi's Pizzeria.\nThe City worked with citizens on developing a long-range plan called City Center Vision Plan. The plan is a specific area plan dedicated to transforming Cedar Hill's City Center into a walkable, mixed-use destination that will have a sense of place. City Center consists of 3 sub districts referred to as Uptown, Midtown and Historic Downtown. City Council adopted the City Center Development Plan in October 2014, the implementation of this plan is fully underway. Implementation of the Plan has four components: Regulation Actions, Economic/Financing Strategies, Communication/Marketing and Projects.\nIn 2014, a $26 million project was developed in Midtown area. Midtown Apartments is a 255-unit, 3-apartment story complex that lies within the City Center area plan providing residents direct access to outdoor recreation activities, retail and restaurants. The development was recognized in 2014 as Best Real Estate Deal in Multifamily Deal by Dallas Business Journal.\nCedar Hill has set aside 20% of its land for parks and green space. 3,000 acres of nature reserves and preserves are located in Cedar Hill including Dogwood Canyon and Cedar Hill State Park.\nDogwood Canyon was formed by the convergence of two ecosystems: the Blackland Prairie, which covers the majority of Dallas County, and the white rock of the Austin Chalk deposits.\nWildlife living in the canyon include birds such as the painted bunting, black-capped vireo, and golden-cheeked warbler, the latter two of which are endangered. Wildlife species include bobcats, coyotes, lizards, and snakes.\nThe canyon is named for the flowering Dogwoods found throughout the escarpment. Other plant life found in Dogwood Canyon include the White trout-lily as well as three species of Hexalectris orchids, which are among only a few hundred in the country.\nCedar Hill State Park opened in 1991, and is located on the northeast corner of Joe Pool Lake. The park consists of 1,826 acres of land and over 100 miles of shoreline. The area is a transition zone between the rolling tallgrass prairie with its black clay soil and the rugged limestone escarpment.\nThe park considers the native tallgrass prairie remnants to be its most important natural feature. In the early 1800s a vast tallgrass prairie stretched from Texas to Canada. Today, less than one percent survives. These endangered remnants include Indian grass, little bluestem, big bluestem, sideoats grama, and switchgrass. The park has reintroduced Eastern gamma grass and meadow pinks in selected areas.\nIn the wooded hills of the park, common animals include bobcats, coyotes, foxes, squirrels, armadillos, and raccoons. Lake fishing is good for largemouth bass, white bass, crappie, and catfish.\nThe Cedar Hill State Park has approximately 200 species of birds and is home to many other Neotropical migrants. The most sought after bird at the park is the painted bunting, common from May through August.\nCedar Hill rests on the edge of Joe Pool Lake. The lake was impounded in 1986, has a surface area of 6,469 acres and a maximum depth of 75 feet. Joe Pool Lake can be accessed through the Cedar Hill State Park or any other of the three parks located along its borders.\nCedar Hill hosts local, regional, and national sports tournaments. Cedar Hill\u2019s sports complexes collectively include 21 baseball and softball fields, 18 soccer pitches, 7 basketball courts, 6 tennis courts, 4 football fields, and a 36-hole disc golf course.\nIn the 1950s, Cedar Hill became home to what was then known as Hill Tower. At 880 feet above sea level, Cedar Hill\u2019s elevation made it a desirable location for installation of the broadcast antennas. Hill Tower was the first single tower owned and operated by two television stations at the same time.\nDuring this time, then CBS affiliate, KRLD-TV, and ABC affiliate WFAA-TV, were the leading television stations of Dallas. Both stations were in competition for the same location, thus the idea of Hill Tower was born. The tower would reach over 1,500 feet into the sky and be topped with an 80-foot triangular platform consisting of two antennas, one for each station. Dubbed 'the candelabra', both antennas were of equal height and equal centers of radiation.\nSince the construction of Hill Tower, many other local television and radio stations have located here, and more recently, mobile communications technology service providers. Today, Cedar Hill has the highest concentration of radio and television communication antennas in the county with 14 towers.\nVisible from 20 miles away on a clear night, the towers have become a landmark for travelers. They also serve as a navigational landmark for aircraft pilots who use the towers as a guide.\nFarmers such as John Wesley Penn utilized the natural resources of the land to build farms and provided shelter and sustenance for their families. The Penn family lived and grazed livestock on the native prairie grasses for over a hundred years. During that time, most of the tallgrass prairie in Dallas County vanished \u2013 plowed under and replaced with crops of wheat or cotton. Perhaps because of the rocky surface and hilly terrain of the Cedar Hill area, the prairie remnants at Penn Farm survived and are maintained today.\nPenn Farm Agricultural History Center was created from the remnants of Penn Farm, which date back to the 1850s. The center is located within Cedar Hill State Park. It was designed to educate people about early life in Cedar Hill and to demonstrate how human invention rendered the greatest impact on the tallgrass prairie once prominent in this area. Many of the original structures still remain standing, showing the evolution of machinery constructed and adapted by the Penn family as needs changed and modern conveniences were added.\nDogwood Canyon Audubon Center was built as a partnership between Cedar Hill and the National Audubon Society. On April 23, 2008, John Flicker, former president of the National Audubon Society, led the groundbreaking ceremonies for the Dogwood Canyon Audubon Center. The Center officially opened in 2011.\nThe visitor center has been awarded Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification, established by the U.S. Green Building Council and verified by the Green Building Certification Institute (GBCI), for energy use, lighting, water, and material use as well as incorporating a variety of other sustainable strategies.\nIn 2015, Dogwood Canyon Audubon Center partnered with the Cedar Hill Independent School District on a study linking outdoor science education to academic performance. The study involved 500 5th grade students from Cedar Hill ISD. The students participated weekly in the Audubon Center\u2019s customized Eco Investigations lessons. Those who participated scored 20% higher on related STAAR questions then nonparticipants. This study is the first of its kind in Texas.\nCedar Hill manages and maintains 32 park properties including 6 community parks, 17 neighborhood parks, 1 special purpose park, 3 nature preserves, and 4 greenbelts.\nCedar Hill currently has over 45 miles of multi-purpose, integrated trails and bikeways. Most recent additions include Pleasant Run Trail, Lake Ridge Hike and Bike Trail, and Red Oak Creek Trail.\nDORBA Trail is the longest trail located in Cedar Hill State Park and is a shared use hike and bike trail. The trail was created through the efforts of the Dallas Off-Road Bicycle Association, hence the trail name, and the Cedar Hill State Park management. It is considered one of the top mountain biking trails in the state.\nAn ADA accessible trail can be found at the Dogwood Canyon Audubon Center.\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification system, Cedar Hill has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \"Cfa\" on climate maps. This type of weather is typical throughout the densely populated parts of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 704, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 704, "length": 791, "sectionHeading": "History | 1856 Tornado", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1495, "length": 1170, "sectionHeading": "History | Cedar Hill Bank Robbery", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2665, "length": 1501, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4166, "length": 2245, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6411, "length": 759, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7170, "length": 4468, "sectionHeading": "Economic development", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 11638, "length": 191, "sectionHeading": "Attractions | Nature", "sectionLabel": "city.environment"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 11829, "length": 655, "sectionHeading": "Attractions | Nature | Dogwood Canyon", "sectionLabel": "city.environment"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 12484, "length": 1109, "sectionHeading": "Attractions | Nature | Cedar Hill State Park", "sectionLabel": "city.environment"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 13593, "length": 268, "sectionHeading": "Attractions | Nature | Joe Pool Lake", "sectionLabel": "city.environment"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 13861, "length": 259, "sectionHeading": "Attractions | Sports", "sectionLabel": "city.sport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 14120, "length": 1250, "sectionHeading": "Attractions | Points of Interest | Towers", "sectionLabel": "city.sights"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 15370, "length": 1064, "sectionHeading": "Attractions | Points of Interest | Penn Farm Agricultural History Center", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 16434, "length": 1107, "sectionHeading": "Attractions | Points of Interest | Dogwood Canyon Audubon Center", "sectionLabel": "city.sights"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 17541, "length": 166, "sectionHeading": "Recreation | Parks", "sectionLabel": "city.recreation"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 17707, "length": 597, "sectionHeading": "Recreation | Hike and Bike", "sectionLabel": "city.recreation"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 18304, "length": 341, "sectionHeading": "Climate", "sectionLabel": "city.climate"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batesville,_Arkansas", "type": "city", "title": "Batesville, Arkansas", "abstract": "Batesville is the county seat and largest city of Independence County, Arkansas, United States, 80 miles (183 km) northeast of Little Rock, the state capital.

The city serves as a regional manufacturing and distribution hub for the Ozark Mountain region and northeast Arkansas.\n", "text": "Batesville is the second oldest municipality in the state of Arkansas, after Georgetown. It was named for the first territorial delegate from Arkansas to the Congress of the United States, James Woodson Bates, who settled in the town. The town has also gone by the names of Napoleon and Poke Bayou.\nIn early days, Batesville was an important port on the White River and served as an entry point to the interior of northern Arkansas. Batesville played a large role in the settling of the Ozark Mountains region and served as the central land office for northern Arkansas.\nThe first known settlement of the Batesville area was in 1810 near the mouth of Polk Bayou, and by 1819 the town had a ferry across the White River and about a dozen houses. The town was partially laid out in early 1821, and on March 3, 1822 a bill of assurrance was recorded and executed and the town's plat was laid out. Batesville became the county seat in 1821. In January 1822, Judge Richard Searcy opened the town's first state circuit court. The town's first post office was established in 1822, and in 1830 became the home of a county court. On 25 September 1836, shortly after Arkansas was granted its statehood, Governor Conway incorporated Batesville Academy, the state's first academy. In the past, the area in and around the city had extensive quarries of manganese ore, phosphate rock, sandstone, limestone, and marble.\nBatesville currently has only one high school within the city limits, Batesville High School. Also, Batesville is the home of Lyon College, a private liberal arts college affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and noted for the annual Arkansas Scottish Festival each spring. In addition, the city is home to the University of Arkansas Community College at Batesville (UACCB), and NASCAR driver Mark Martin. It contains three National Register Historic Districts and many properties separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was listed in Norman Crampton's 1992 book The 100 Best Small Towns in America, ranking at #75.\nBatesville is located at (35.773488, -91.641338).

In 2007, the city had a median income of $83,569. Additionally, like the rest of the Seattle area, house prices have risen rapidly; the median value in 2007 was $567,000. Based on per capita income, Mukilteo ranks 29th of 522 areas in the state of Washington. In 2009, Mukilteo was ranked as number 10 of Money magazine's top 100 small towns of America to live in. In 2011, Mukilteo rose one rank to number 9.\n", "text": "Though the word Mukilteo is widely believed to mean \"good camping site,\" the HistoryLink.org site notes that in the Snohomish dialect Muk-wil-teo means \"narrow passage,\" a reference to the sand spit that formed the original Mukilteo landing. Mukilteo was officially incorporated on May 8, 1947, but the city has a historic role in the development of the Puget Sound. It was at Mukilteo that the Point Elliott Treaty was signed between Governor Isaac Stevens and the chiefs of 22 Puget Sound tribes on January 22, 1855.\nThe treaty ceded land to the United States from Point Pully (now called Three Tree Point south of Seattle) to the British (Canada) border in exchange for a variety of benefits, including land, education, health care and hunting and fishing rights. The treaty was signed before more than 2,500 Native Americans.\nAccording to the Mukilteo Historical Society, the town became the first settled by Europeans in 1858 and was the temporary county seat of Snohomish County for several months in 1861 after Snohomish County was created from Island County. The city of Snohomish was designated as county seat in July 1861. Initially the settlement was called Point Elliott, the name given the location by the Wilkes Expedition in 1841.\nIn its early years, Mukilteo was a fishing village, trading post, and a port-of-entry. Surrounding wooded hills filled with Douglas fir, cedar and hemlock supported a lumber mill and the town also had a cannery, a brewery, and a gunpowder plant. Traces of the powder mill remain in the name of Powder Mill Gulch, a ravine that is located about one mile (1.6 km) into the city limits of Everett. Japanese Gulch provides rail access from the Mukilteo waterfront to the Boeing's Boeing Everett Factory at Paine Field.\nIn 1900, the population was only 350. The next year, the federal Lighthouse Board decided to put a light and fog signal at the point in Mukilteo. The lighthouse, which still stands today, was completed in 1906.\nEven at incorporation in 1947, almost a century after the Point Elliott Treaty, Mukilteo's population stood at only 775. But by 1947, there was ferry service to Whidbey Island, a fuel storage facility for the Air Force on the waterfront, and a major rail line for the Great Northern Railway along the city's entire waterfront.\nThe first growth spurt for the city came with the 1980 annexation of an additional to the south along the Mukilteo Speedway or SR 525, which increased the population to 4,130 people. In 1991, the Harbour Pointe area was annexed, doubling the size of the city to . The annexation increased the city's population to just over 10,000 and also presaged a shift from the Old Town commercial center near the ferry to new shopping and banking facilities at Harbour Pointe. With development since the Harbour Pointe annexation, the city's population has reached 19,360 (2005). The city has agreed to an urban growth area that includes approximately 15,000 additional potential residents.\nThe major parkland in the city is the former state park and lighthouse, next to the ferry docks. In 1954, the state acquired of land around the lighthouse and made it into a state park, including a popular boat ramp. In 2003, the state faced a budgetary crisis and offered to cede the park to the city, which the city accepted. The city renamed the park Mukilteo Lighthouse Park and has plans for redevelopment that may ultimately spend $6 million for new facilities.\nSubstantial development is expected along the waterfront in the next five to ten years, with the state planning to build a new ferry terminal east of the current location. The Mukilteo-Clinton ferry provides service for 3 million passengers per year with two ferries currently serving the run.\nIn 1992, the government of Mukilteo opposed plans to expand Paine Field; Mayor Brian Sullivan said that the city disagrees \"with the idea of a Sea-Tac north\" and supports upholding a 1978 agreement between residents around Paine Field and Snohomish County.\nThe transportation hub will use some of the land being turned over by the federal government on the site of the old fuel docks. Included is an $18 million terminal for Sounder commuter rail service, scheduled to open in June, 2008 on the Everett-Seattle line. In addition, the city and Port of Everett are working to redevelop the remaining land on the tank farm property for private and public use.\nHarbour Pointe is a mixed-use neighborhood at the south end of Mukilteo on land originally owned by Port Gamble Lumber Co. Harbour Pointe is the location of Kamiak High School, Harbour Pointe Middle School, and Columbia Elementary School. After cutting timber from the area, Port Gamble sold it to Standard Oil of California (now Chevron) in the 1930s with the petroleum company planning to put a refinery on the property.\nWhen the Alaskan oil fields were developed in the 1960s, Standard Oil decided that there was adequate capacity for refining at Anacortes and set aside plans to build a refinery on the property. In a locally published book, \"Picnic Point Pathways,\" author Sandy Sandborg says that the decision was probably influenced by the environmental battle that Richfield Oil Company had with its planned refinery development at Kayak Point, north of Everett, during the 1960s.\nA parcel of that would become Picnic Point Park, just south of the city's border, was leased to Snohomish County in 1970. Then, in 1977, Standard Oil donated it to the county. Another were purchased by Harbour Pointe Limited Partnership in the 1980s from Standard Oil. It would become the mixed-used development anchored by Harbour Pointe Golf Club, opened in September, 1989.\nThe Mukilteo School District includes all of the city, but also a portion of south Everett and unincorporated areas to the south of the city. The district serves a population of 68,000, or more than 3 times that of the city alone. The district had more than 14,163 students in 2004-2005 and a budget of $104.7 million.\nThere are three high schools (one alternative), four middle schools, and eleven elementary schools in addition to other education programs such as the Sno-Isle TECH Skills Center. Nine of these schools are award-winning, with seven receiving Washington Achievement Awards between 2009 and 2011. These schools currently serve around 14,000 students.\nMukilteo is located at (47.916148, -122.302939).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.\nThe city is traversed by the Southern Whidbey Island fault zone, discovered in 1996.\nMuch of the area surrounding Mukilteo to the east is unincorporated Snohomish county. To the west and north is Puget Sound. Everett, Puget Sound and unincorporated Snohomish county make up the majority of the border.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $107,323, and the median income for a family was $117,487 (these figures had risen to $108,043 and $119,735 respectively as of a 2007 estimate).

Washington State's Olympic Peninsula from the main portion of the state of Washington. Most of the community is on a hillside that faces north or west towards Whidbey Island. \"Mukilteo By the Bay\" and \"Mukilteo By the Sea\" are variations of a slogan frequently seen on license plate frames in and around Mukilteo.\nThough boating and fishing are popular in the area, there is only one boat launch with two seasonal docks and no marina in the city. At one point there were two boathouses on the waterfront, Mukilteo Boat House and McConnell's Boathouse, but both have been demolished and replaced with a condominium apartment building and a hotel respectively. The Lighthouse Park area and pilings near the ferry dock and hotel are popular places for local divers, due to the diversity of sea life and presence of squid. There are two public fishing piers, one on each side of the Ivar's restaurant.\nSnohomish County Airport is located to the southeast of Mukilteo and home to Boeing's Everett factory.\nMukilteo has a car ferry terminal that connects to Clinton, on Whidbey Island. The city is served by SR 525, which travels between the Mukilteo ferry terminal and Lynnwood on the Mukilteo Speedway, and SR 526, which serves the Boeing Everett Factory.\nTrain service is provided by Sound Transit through its Sounder commuter rail route to Seattle, stopping at Mukilteo Station east of the ferry terminal. Community Transit operates local bus service on the Mukilteo Speedway toward a park and ride in Lynnwood, as well as commuter routes to Downtown Seattle and the University of Washington.\nThe Rane Corporation, a pro audio equipment manufacturer, is headquartered in Mukilteo. Boeing has a factory in Everett, WA where the 747, 767 and 777 are built that is directly adjacent to Mukilteo, WA and employs many residents and visitors of Mukilteo. The tours of this factory leave from the Future of Flight Aviation Center in Mukilteo, WA.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 4398, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4398, "length": 1266, "sectionHeading": "History | Harbour Pointe", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5664, "length": 668, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6332, "length": 460, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6792, "length": 458, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7250, "length": 1193, "sectionHeading": "Demographics | 2010 census", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 8443, "length": 1274, "sectionHeading": "Demographics | 2000 census", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 9717, "length": 1113, "sectionHeading": "Government and politics", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 10830, "length": 7112, "sectionHeading": "Government and politics | Past Councilmembers", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 17942, "length": 989, "sectionHeading": "Next to the Sea", "sectionLabel": "city.other"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 18931, "length": 693, "sectionHeading": "Transportation", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 19624, "length": 347, "sectionHeading": "Industry", "sectionLabel": "city.district"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milano,_Texas", "type": "city", "title": "Milano, Texas", "abstract": "Milano is a city in Milam County, Texas, United States, located at the intersection of U.S. Route 79 and State Highway 36, twelve miles southeast of Cameron, the county seat. Its population was 400 at the time of the 2000 census, and, in July 2005, it was estimated at 421.\nOn November 5, 1960, Country music singer Johnny Horton was killed by a drunk driver on Highway 79 near Milano on his way home from a performance at the Skyline Club in Austin, Texas.\n", "text": "Milano is located at (30.709190, -96.863420).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and 0.51% is water.\nThe International-Great Northern Railroad Company laid out the original site of Milano in 1874, about a mile and a half west of the city's present site. A United States post office opened there the same year. Soon, a Baptist church was also established in the area. The community around Milano became a voting precinct in 1880.\nLocal sources offer several possibilities for the origin of the name \"Milano.\" One story suggests that the town was simply named after Milan, Italy, because of similarities in the climate, but truly, the climate of Milan in Northern Italy, is cold and continental; another says that the name was supposed to have been \"Milam,\" but the United States Post Office Department either got it wrong or changed it intentionally because another Milam, Texas, already existed.\nNevertheless, when the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad Company built the section of track between Brenham and Belton in 1881, it established the town of Milano Junction at the railway's intersection with the International-Great Northern, about two miles east of Milano. As the focus of social and economic life shifted to the new town, Milano became \"Old Milano\" and Milano Junction became Milano. By the late 1880s, Milano was a commercial hub, with 500 residents, and served as a shipping point for cotton and hides produced in the area. Truck farming became an important industry for Milano in the 1920s, with tomatoes, watermelon, and cantaloupes as the principal crops.\nThe small city of Milano reached its population peak in 1939, when approximately 920 residents were reported to be living there. The number of local residents began to decline in the early 1940s, and fell to a low of 380 by the early 1970s, before beginning to grow again in the late 1970s. By the time Milano was finally incorporated in the early 1980s, the city officially had 468 residents.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 400 people, 151 households, and 112 families residing in the city. The population density was 205.3 people per square mile (79.2/km\u00b2). There were 192 housing units at an average density of 98.5/sq mi (38.0/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the city was 82.00% White, 11.75% African American, 2.00% Native American, 0.75% Asian, 3.50% from other races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 11.50% of the population.\nThere were 151 households out of which 36.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.6% were married couples living together, 14.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 25.2% were non-families. 23.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 13.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.65 and the average family size was 3.13.\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 27.8% under the age of 18, 11.8% from 18 to 24, 24.8% from 25 to 44, 20.8% from 45 to 64, and 15.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females there were 88.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.0 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $28,750, and the median income for a family was $37,292. Males had a median income of $30,417 versus $19,107 for females. The per capita income for the city was $13,771. About 14.6% of families and 17.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 23.0% of those under age 18 and 9.4% of those age 65 or over.\nThe City of Milano is served by the Milano Independent School District:\n- Milano Elementary School (grades PK-5)\n- Milano Junior High School (grades 6-8)\n- Milano High School (grades 9-12)\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 160, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 160, "length": 1869, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2029, "length": 1556, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3585, "length": 189, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhangzhou", "type": "city", "title": "Zhangzhou", "abstract": "Zhangzhou, formerly romanized as Changchow, is a prefecture-level city in Fujian Province, China. The prefecture around the city proper comprises the southeast corner of the province, facing the Taiwan Strait and surrounding the prefecture of Xiamen. During the 2010 census, the entire area of Zhangzhou was home to 4,809,983 inhabitants. Along with the 1.9m people of central Xiamen, its urban districts of Longwen and Xiangcheng, together with Longhai, form a single metropolitan area of about 5 million people .\n", "text": "Zhangzhou is the atonal pinyin romanization of the city's Chinese name , using its pronunciation in Standard Mandarin. The name derives from the city's former status as the seat of the imperial Chinese Zhang Prefecture. The same name was romanized as \"Changchow\" on the Chinese Postal Map and Chang-chou in Wade-Giles. Other romanizations include Chang-chow. \nIt also appears as Chang-chu, Chiang-chiu, Chiang-chew, or Chiang Chew from the city's local Hokkien name Chiang-chiu. This name appeared in Spanish and Portuguese Jesuit sources as , which was anglicized as Chinchew. By the 19th century, however, this name had migrated and was used to refer to Quanzhou, a separate port about east-northeast of central Zhangzhou.\nZhangzhou proper lies on the banks of the Jiulong River in southern Fujian about from central Xiamen, whose urban core has grown to form a single urbanized area with it. The prefecture of Zhangzhou comprises the southeastern corner of the province, surrounding Xiamen. The prefecture of Quanzhou lies to its northeast, Longyan to its northwest, and Shantou in Guangdong to its southwest.\nZhangzhou has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa), with mild to warm winters and long, very hot and humid summers. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, and the annual mean is . The frost-free period lasts 330 days.\n\nDuring the early Qing, Zhangzhou was the primary Fujianese port trading with Portuguese Macao and Spanish Manila. For a time, the Portuguese maintained a factory in the city.\nDuring the late Qing, Zhangzhou remained a center of silk, brick, and sugar production with about a million people and extensive internal and maritime trade. Its city wall had a circumference of about but included a good deal of open ground and farmland. Its streets were paved with granite but badly maintained. The bridge across the Jiulong River consisted of wooden planks laid between 25 piles of stones at roughly equal intervals. The port of Xiamen in an island at the mouth of the Jiulong principally functioned as a trading center for the produce and wares of Zhangzhou and its hinterland; both suffered economically when Indian tea plantations cratered demand for Fujianese tea in the late 19th century.\nThe old city of Zhangzhou (now Xiangcheng District) was occupied in April and May 1932 by a column of Communist guerrillas under Mao Zedong. Due to the presence of Western gunboats in Xiamen Bay, arms shipments from the Soviet Union were unable to get up the Jiulong River to Mao's forces and the main Communist bases. Discovering this, Mao retreated from the city, according to some accounts with a substantial amount of loot taken from its residents.\nZhangzhou comprises 2 urban districts, 1 county-level city, and 8 counties.\n1. Xiangcheng District ( )\n2. Longwen District ( )\n3. Longhai City ( )\n4. Changtai County ( )\n5. Dongshan County ( )\n6. Hua'an County ( )\n7. Nanjing County ( )\n8. Pinghe County ( )\n9. Yunxiao County ( )\n10. Zhangpu County ( )\n11. Zhao'an County ( )\nThe main language of the Zhangzhounese is the local dialect of Min Nan, part of the Southern Min branch of Min Chinese.

It was repurposed for artistic use a few years later and gained imperial favor under the Qianlong Emperor. It remains prized for its bright color and pleasant smell.\nA major petrochemical plant, producing paraxylene, owned by Taiwan-based Xianglu Group is located in Zhangzhou's Gulei Peninsula. The plant suffered major fires in 2013 and 2015.\nTwo passenger stations serve Zhangzhou:\n- Zhangzhou East Railway Station on the older Yingtan\u2013Xiamen Railway, northeast of the city;\n- Zhangzhou Railway Station, the junction of the high-speed Xiamen\u2013Shenzhen Railway and Longyan\u2013Xiamen Railway, opened in 2012, south of the city.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 725, "sectionHeading": "Name", "sectionLabel": "city.etymology"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 725, "length": 388, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1113, "length": 278, "sectionHeading": "Geography | Climate", "sectionLabel": "city.climate"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1391, "length": 1341, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2732, "length": 325, "sectionHeading": "Administrative divisions", "sectionLabel": "city.district"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3057, "length": 204, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3261, "length": 438, "sectionHeading": "Economy", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3699, "length": 280, "sectionHeading": "Transportation", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaffney,_South_Carolina", "type": "city", "title": "Gaffney, South Carolina", "abstract": "Gaffney is a town in and the seat of Cherokee County, South Carolina, United States, in the Upstate region of South Carolina.

It is the principal city of the Gaffney, South Carolina, Micropolitan Statistical Area (population 55,662 according to 2012 estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau), which includes all of Cherokee County and which is further included in the greater Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson, South Carolina Combined Statistical Area (population 1,384,996 according to year 2012 U.S. Census Bureau estimates).\n", "text": "Michael A. Gaffney, born in Granard, Ireland, in 1775, emigrated to the United States in 1797, arriving in New York City and moving to Charleston, South Carolina, a few years later. Gaffney moved again in 1804 to the South Carolina Upcountry and established a tavern and lodging house at what became known as \"Gaffney's Cross Roads\". The location was perfect for growth because of the two major roads which met here, one from the mountains of North Carolina to Charleston and the other from Charlotte into Georgia. Michael Gaffney died here on September 6, 1854.\nIn 1872, the area became known as \"Gaffney City\". Gaffney became the county seat of Cherokee County which was formed out of parts of York, Union, and Spartanburg counties in 1897. Gaffney became a major center for the textile industry in South Carolina, which was the backbone of the county's economy up until the 1980s.\nDespite the small amount of population growth, businesses and companies continue to locate within the city limits, especially along the bustling Floyd Baker Boulevard and Highway 105 and many other areas within the city limits. However, most population growth recently has occurred outside of the city limits.\nUptown Gaffney began to languish after Interstate 85 was built in the county as industries located near the new highway. Recent renovations in downtown Gaffney have prompted more businesses to locate there, but there is still a great deal that is planned for the central part of the city. Many plans have been announced for the downtown area, including a park that is currently being developed on the grounds of a recently demolished mill (Gaffney Manufacturing Co.). A plaza has been completed beside city hall and includes a refurbished fountain and extensive landscaping. Highlights to the upgrade of the city's park system include a skatepark, two passive parks, and several children's playgrounds.\nIn 2008, the Cherokee County History & Arts Museum opened on College Drive in the historic Central Elementary School building. The museum is operated by the Cherokee Historical & Preservation Society and is located on the mustering ground of the South Carolina militia (1812\u20131914). Located just blocks from downtown Gaffney and in one of the city's three nationally registered historic sites, the museum offers new cultural opportunities for locals and visitors, while having a positive economic impact for the downtown area. Annual events include a pottery show, car show, and ghost walk.\nThe city has recently hired an architectural firm to renovate the old Gaffney Post Office, located at the intersection of Frederick and Granard streets, into a visitor's center and art gallery.\nThere are also plans for a large cultural center to be placed in the downtown area. In 2009 Darren Mason was elected president of the Gaffney Downtown Business Association and has worked closely with city officials in revitalizing the Historic Downtown area which consists of about six blocks. New matching fund programs have been key to restoring old buildings by painting and using attractive awnings to spruce up the old look of main street.\nGaffney Station Farmers' Market has been established in a city parking lot directly across from the old post office downtown. The farmers' market operates on Wednesdays and Saturdays from June through October. There are plans to create a more permanent site for the farmer's market at that location. The city of Gaffney plans to build a partial replica of the old train depot that was once located there. The replica will house a portion of the farmer's market and also act as a landmark that calls back to the days of the old depot.\nThe city concluded Spring Session '08 of a popular concert series entitled \"Shindig at the Gaffney Cabin\". Bands perform on a weekly basis: Fridays during the Spring Session (May) and Thursdays during the Fall Session (late August through September). Concerts are held on Thursdays during Fall Sessions so as not to conflict with Gaffney Indian football games on Friday nights. The city will hold more of those concerts in 2009, this time from April to June 2009, and again from August to October of the same year.\nTwo serial killers have at different times attacked residents of Gaffney. In 1968 Lee Roy Martin, known as the Gaffney Strangler, killed four women. In 2009, a series of shootings led to five deaths.\nThe Archeological Site 38CK1, Archeological Site 38CK44, Archeological Site 38CK45, Carnegie Free Library, Coopersville Ironworks Site (38CK2) and Susan Furnace Site (38CK67), Cowpens Furnace Site (38CK73), Winnie Davis Hall, Ellen Furnace Site (38CK68), Gaffney Commercial Historic District, Gaffney Residential Historic District, Irene Mill Finishing Plant, Jefferies House, Limestone Springs Historic District, Magness-Humphries House, Nesbitt's Limestone Quarry (38CK69), and Settlemyer House are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe city of Gaffney and surrounding Cherokee County came into the national spotlight during the summer of 2009 when a spree killer began killing residents of the rural town.\nThe first victim, a prominent peach farmer from western Cherokee County, was killed on June 27. On July 1, the killer was responsible for the death of an 83-year-old woman and her 50-year-old daughter. The two were found bound and shot to death in the elder woman's home near Gaffney. On July 2, 46-year-old Stephen Tyler was shot and killed in his appliance and furniture store; his teenage daughter, Abby, was critically wounded; she died of her injuries two days later.\nThe news spread quickly from the local newspaper to national and international media outlets including CNN, ABC News, The Wall Street Journal, and the BBC.\nOn July 6, police responding to an emergency call of a burglary in progress in Gaston County, North Carolina, shot and killed a suspect who drew a gun on them, injuring one officer. Ballistic tests and checks on the suspect's SUV indicated this to be the wanted killer, later identified as Patrick Tracy Burris.\nGaffney is located in northern South Carolina at (35.071667, -81.650000), near the center of Cherokee County. It is located southwest of Charlotte, North Carolina and northeast of Greenville, South Carolina, both reached via Interstate 85. It is served by the Charlotte and Greenville major airports. These airports are almost equidistant from Gaffney, with Greenville being slightly closer. It is also approximately northeast of Atlanta, Georgia. The closest large city is Spartanburg, South Carolina, which is southwest on I-85.\nInterstate 85 passes along the northern edge of Gaffney, with access from Exits 90, 92, and 95.

Hunt was granted a charter from the West Fork Bridge Company to build a bridge across the West Fork of the Trinity River. The bridge was located approximately one mile southwest of the present townsite. A Texas State Historical Marker alongside Farm To Market Road 920 denotes the spot of the original bridge today .\nThe wooden bridge was used for a portion of the Butterfield Overland Mail stage route used for only a few months between August 1860 and March 1861. After the American Civil War began, the mail route was no longer used and the original wooden bridge was abandoned, deteriorated and collapsed into the river.\nIn 1873 a new iron bridge was built and a post office established, thus formally creating the city of Bridgeport, TX. Its future was assured in 1882 when Charles Cates discovered a vein of bituminous coal while drilling for water. The Wise County Coal Company was formed and was a leading producer of coal for the state until competition from natural gas and petroleum closed the coal mines in 1929.\nIn 1893 the Rock Island Railroad established a line east of the town, so the town moved approximately one mile east to its present site. In 1913 the town was incorporated. Gas and Oil production became a local industry prior to 1917. The 1920s census showed a town of 1,872. During the 1920s, limestone quarries that produced aggregate for road construction and a brick factory were established. In 1931, a dam was constructed approximately three miles west of town on the West Fork of the Trinity River, creating Lake Bridgeport. The lake was a local center for recreation and remains so today.\nDuring the latter half of the 20th century, Bridgeport's oil, gas, and limestone industries continued to flourish and the town became the second largest town in Wise County. These industries continue to be the local economic leaders.\nBridgeport is served by the Bridgeport Independent School District.\nLake Bridgeport is located west of the city and offers recreational boating and watersports, as well as freshwater fishing.\nThe City operates Northwest OHV Park on the north of the city limits. This is a 300-acre park for motorcycles, ATVs, UTVs, and Jeeps to roam over trails through varied terrain.\nFor almost 100 years, Bridgeport was served by the First National Bank of Bridgeport. The bank was purchased in the late 1900s by primary investors Billie C. Green, W.W. \"Wilson\" Ray, and M.L. Manoushagian. It, however, was sold in December 2005 to First Financial Bankcards (stock symbol FFIN) based in Abilene and became part of a six branch bank consisting of institutions in Bridgeport, Boyd, Decatur, Keller, and Trophy Club.\nThe Community Bank opened the doors for business in June 2007. It is the only locally owned and independently operated bank in Bridgeport, Texas. Every year, the bank donates thousands of dollars and numerous hours of community service to the school district and local charities.\nThe Community Bank is guided by officers Carl Russell, Theresa East, and Joe Murphy.\nKyle Clifton, formerly of the NFL New York Jets, graduated from Bridgeport High School in 1980 after having been born in Olney, Texas. Although he played linebacker at Texas Christian University and then the Jets, Clifton played quarterback for the Bridgeport Bulls his junior and senior years leading the Bulls to a 9-1 record in the former (losing only to Bowie at home). He was a third round draft pick of the Jets and played with the team his entire career which lasted thirteen seasons from 1984-1996.\nColin Jones (American football), NFL safety for the Carolina Panthers.\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters.

It was the capital of the expansive province of the same name from 1750 until its dissolution in 1911, covering a third of Mindanao Island's total land area. It is one of the oldest port towns in Mindanao, founded by Spanish colonizers in 1655. It has abundant mineral reserves including gold, iron, manganese, silica, cobalt, copper, chromite and among the world's largest nickel deposits in Nonoc Island. The Asian Institute of Management ranks the city as among the most competitive small-sized cities in the Philippines, with an estimated total income of 600 million pesos in 2012.\nThe city serves as a jump off point to visitors of nearby Siargao, Dinagat and Bucas Grande islands. It is Mindanao's closest landmass to the Visayas region. Eleven nautical miles across Surigao Strait separates the city from Panaon Island in the Visayas. Surigao is the center of politics, commerce, banking, industry and education of Surigao del Norte and Dinagat Islands as well as parts of neighboring provinces of Surigao del Sur, Agusan del Norte and Southern Leyte.\n", "text": "According to local historians, there are many versions regarding the meaning of Surigao and how this was derived. Like Sulo, which means sulog or current, the name Surigao may have been originally coined from the Spanish word surgir, meaning swift current.\nThere is also a popular legend about Visayan fishermen who went adrift on a stormy day at the mouth of today's Surigao River. With boats wrecked, they were unable to sail back to sea. They were met by a docile village chieftain named Solibao who offered them his abode. The fishermen helped the chieftain procure food for the village's daily subsistence in exchange for his hospitality. One day, with much luck, they were able to paddle back home with the help of other fisherman who made it to the village they now named Solibao. Some of the men eventually returned and settled in the area. During the 15th century, Spanish galleons dropped anchor near the settlement and came ashore. The Spanish historian, worn from the long transpacific journey misheard the people when he asked where they were, and instead wrote in his diaries Surigao, referring to the land at the north-easternmost tip of Mindanao Island.\nThe town was renamed Caraga after its founding, derived from the word calagan which means \"land of the brave\" or \"fierce people\". The Italian adventurer Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri, who published a book of travel in the country, cited Francisco Combes, S.J. as a source in saying that Calagan is derived from the two Visayan words, kalag for soul and an for people. Today, Caraga is the official name referring to the entire Region XIII, created through Republic Act No. 7901 on February 25, 1995, making it the newest region in the Philippines.\nSurigao City is situated at the north-easternmost tip of Mindanao Island. It is bounded by Municipalities of Dinagat and Basilisa to the north, Philippine Sea and the Municipality of Cagdianao to the east, Municipalities of Sison and Tagana-an to the south, Mindanao Sea and the Municipality of San Francisco to the west and the Surigao Strait to the north-west.\nSurigao City is marked by rolling hills that gently buffers its eastern and western boundaries. To the south-west towers the Kabangkaan Ridge which divides the city from the municipality of San Francisco (formerly Anao-aon). Kinabutan River (otherwise known as Surigao River) meanders Surigao valley before it empties to the Surigao tidal basin, a shrinking mangrove swamp fast overtaken by the city's expansion. It has an average elevation of 19 meters or 65.5 ft. above sea level. The highest elevation on the mainland at the Kabangkaan Ridge has a peak elevation of 465 meters above sea level. Along the border of Tagana-an is Mapawa Peak with an elevation of 245 meters above sea level. Barangays Cabongbongan, Nabago and Capalayan are at the foot of its slopes.\nMore than two dozen islands and islets make up two fifths of the city's total land area. They are separated from the mainland by Hinatuan Passage, which connects Mindanao Sea to the Pacific Ocean. The largest island of Nonoc is marked by a rusty-red weathering mantle of lateritic nickel ore, visible from any vantage point on the mainland coast. Its highest elevation at 263 meters above sea level typifies most of its hilly terrain. Across the channel at Hikdop Island, the highest point is Mt. Telegrapo at 100.05 meters. Hinatuan Island is similar to Nonoc's bare and rusty-red hilly appearance. Other notable islands of Hanigad, Sibale, Bayaganan and Awasan are generally flat, covered mostly with coconut trees and assorted hardwoods. Large swaths of mangrove and nipa palm forests cover its brackish waterways and shallow fringes of its coastlines.\nLike most of the country, Surigao is officially considered a tropical rainforest climate type, K\u00f6ppen class Af with an average monthly precipitation of 308.66 mm (12.5 inches). It is distinctly wettest between the months of November until March. During the drier season between April to September, brief afternoon showers and thunderstorms locally called sobasco, are commonplace.\nThe site around Surigao was settled early on, even before the Spanish conquest. Fishing villages dotted along the coast facing the Hinatuan Passage while Mamanwa tribes inhabited the interior highlands. The confluence of three major bodies of water- Pacific Ocean, Surigao Strait and Mindanao Sea, kept the area inhabited continuously for many centuries, although its historical importance waxed and waned as other parts of the archipelago were explored and developed. Nearby archeological digs attest early influences by Chinese, Hindu and Moro traders. At which time, it had been a territory ruled under the Rajahnate of Butuan.\nFerdinand Magellan sailed into the Philippine Archipelago, reaching the island of Homonhon in an epic voyage of discovery and eventual circumnavigation of the world in 1521. Magellan's fleet proceeded to Limasawa through Surigao Strait, a notch north-west of the city's pelagic boundaries, before dropping anchor on the waters off the island of Cebu, ushering the Spanish colonization of the Philippines.\nPresent day Surigao originated from a site in the city proper formerly known as Bilang-Bilang where it served as a port of call for inter-island vessels. It was renamed Banahao which became an integral part of the old district of Caraga, a town founded on June 29, 1655. After Caolo, present day Siargao, burned in 1750, Surigao became the capital of the expansive geopolitical, eclessiastical and military district of Surigao which reached the fringes of Davao and would include today's provinces of Surigao del Sur, Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, parts of Compostela Valley, Misamis Oriental, Davao del Norte and Davao Oriental. It officially became the permanent residence of the Augustinian Recollects on February 1, 1752, when all the canonical books were moved from Caolo to Surigao. The first canonical books bore the signature of Fr. Lucas de la Cruz. Previously, the place was just a \"vista\" of the parish in Caolo. Its strategic location and new status as the seat of government was costly. Surigao witnessed violent territorial struggles as it suffered ultimately from relentless Moro raids. In 1752, the town was devastated. Most of its 2,000 inhabitants were either killed or taken as slaves by the Moros.\n- Controversy about the location of the First Philippine Flag Raising in Mindanao. The Philippines' National Historical Institute carries the mandate to decide on historical matters and to erect national markers. In a roundtable held in January 2000, the historians decided that the raising of the flag on December 26, 1898, by Alejandro Gonzalez in Surigao was duly sanctioned by Emilio Aguinaldo's government. The installation of the NHI marker in Surigao City followed suit.\nAt the turn of the century in 1901, the American colonizers established a civil government in the province of Surigao, keeping the town of Surigao as its capital. Surigao was then among the largest municipalities in land area with a jurisdiction of 949.90 square kilometers, larger than today's Butuan. During this period, there was only one main road, the Old Spanish road. The commercial district, market and plaza (Luneta) were all situated in one small area. In 1930, the Old Spanish road was abandoned and a new provincial road was constructed. The Casa Real was built where municipal administrators would hold their official functions. Surigao's core barrios- Taft and Washington, were named after United States presidents William Howard Taft and George Washington.\nSurigao featured prominently in World War II's Pacific theater. On May 23, 1942, the Japanese Imperial Army under Colonel Yoshie occupied Surigao after arriving from Butuan. They formally took over on May 28, 1942, under Lieutenant Ichichara, taking control from Mayor Amat. Filipino guerrilla units based in Surigao continued to operate in the hinterlands. Liberation from the Japanese rule dawned on September 9, 1944. American planes started their campaign by bombing the town in the early morning. It was followed by a strafing of all Japanese warships docked at the Surigao wharf, which came to transport fresh troops and supplies to their forces in Leyte. No less than fifty warships were sunk by the raiding American bomber planes. After the attack, not a single Japanese ship was seen afloat. The following month, on October 24\u201325, the famous Battle of Surigao Strait, the final line battle in naval history, was fiercely fought by allied forces against the Japanese fleet. By April 12, 1945, the whole province of Surigao was liberated from Japanese occupation.\nOne American family who had lived in and near Surigao before the war returned after the Japanese left the area in 1945. Virginia Holmes, a child in 1945, many years later wrote, \"We were shocked at the destruction the war years had wrought. Many houses stood empty, and others were mere skeletons. Walls were pockmarked with bullet holes. There were piles of rubble everywhere. The tree-lined streets that used to be so pretty were now full of potholes, and only a few trees were left undamaged.\" Holmes said the cemetery had been neglected and at least part of it was overgrown in weeds.\nMassive reconstruction followed the destruction brought by the war. The Surigao Provincial Capitol was completed in 1946 atop the hill overlooking the city. Other facilities were built including schools, athletic field and municipal jail. In 1948, the first election of municipal officials was held. In the same year, construction of the Surigao Provincial Hospital commenced. Six years later in 1954, construction of the first municipal building started and was completed in 1955. Economic activities continued to flourish with the launching of gold mining operations by Mindanao Mother Lode Mines in Mabuhay, 10 kilometers away from the city. Rapid economic growth and immigration resulted to losing some of its fishing and agricultural barrios as they were converted into towns of Malimono (July 31, 1956), San Francisco (May 24, 1957) and Sison (September 15, 1959). During the same year, settlements including Capalayan, Libuac, Catadman, Mat-i, Lipata, Dakung Patag, Bunyasan, Cantapoy, Balite, and Bambanon were elevated into barrios, the forerunner of modern-day barangays.\nAt that time, Surigao was classified as a 1st Class B municipality with an annual income of P160,000.00 and a population of nearly 50,000. It was primarily an agricultural town producing mainly copra and basic staples including rice, corn, bananas and rootcrops. Fishing was also a major source of livelihood. On September 18, 1960, pursuant to the Republic Act 2786 dated June 19, 1960, the province of Surigao was divided into Surigao del Norte and Surigao del Sur. The town of Surigao remained as a capital, this time for the province of Surigao del Norte.\nSurigao was on a rapid growth path. Already, it had a domestic airport, three movie houses, three hotels and two hospitals. However, on November 19, 1964, tragedy befell the town as it saw its most massive destruction yet. It was in the direct path of supertyphoon Ining, internationally code- named Louise , with peak winds at 240 kilometers per hour. The wrath of the storm was severe and devastation wide, both in infrastructure and human lives. Just as they overcame the destruction of war, the locals tenacity was again proven in the town's rebuilding. In a short time, after three years in 1967, Pacific Cement Corporation started commercial operations in Mabuhay, producing among the highest quality cement in the country. In 1969, Marinduque Mining Industrial Corporation started nickel exploration in Nonoc Island with an initial capitalization of Php1.0 billion pesos, ushering a new era of prosperity.\nPursuant to Republic Act No. 6134, Surigao was converted to a chartered city on August 31, 1970, with Pedro Espina as its first city mayor.\nThe demographics of Surigao City are evidence of an ethnically diverse city. Throughout its history, Surigao has been a point of entry for immigrants from other regions of the Philippines, enticed by the city's political significance, attractive natural setting, abundant resources and during the last century, increased mining operations. Butuanons, Boholanos, Tagalogs, Ilonggos, Warays, Cebuanos and various Mindanao ethnicities found home in Surigao and eventually learned how to speak the language. Some of their descendants now hold prominent positions in the city and provincial governments. Migrants from China also found home in Surigao; their direct descendants now comprise the bulk of successful merchants of the Surigao business community.\nSurigao is home to one of the country's oldest and most colorful tribes, the Mamanwa. They are similar to the Negritoes of Luzon in features and stature. They are generally short, dark-skinned with a crop of short kinky hair. Forced to settle in the hinterlands due to development, they continued to practice their customs and traditions. The faith about Kahimunan, one of their many tribal festivities, highlights music and graceful dancing. Revelers chant and play while accompanied by native musical instruments including the gimbar (drum), gong and bamboo percussion called kalatong and katik. Wild pigs, chicken and indigenous fruits including the rare kayape are among the offerings. A baylan (priest) presides the celebration as a tribute and invocation to their god Magbabaya and departed ancestors for good health and abundant harvest.\nMamanwas are also known for their creative patterns, brass jewelries and indigenous crafts, displayed proudly on their costumes as they fill the streets at the height of the Bonok Bonok Maradjao Karadjao Festival every September 9, celebrated on the occasion of the feast of Saint Nicolas de Tolentino, Surigao City's patron saint. Bonok-bonok and its prehistoric origins was another ritual to thank their gods, presided by various village chieftains and their wives. Happiness and friendship are expressed through dancing, chanting and singing. They wave scarves of banay as symbols of goodwill, wealth and blessings for all tribal villages.\nToday, most of the Mamanwas still live in the hinterlands, occasionally descending to town to sell or barter handicrafts and fresh harvest. Bands still subsist on foraging even as majority of them have adopted a more modern way of life over the years.\nSinurigaonon, the official language in the city and province is unique among the Visayan languages. It is also spoken by the majority of the population in the province of Surigao del Sur and around Lake Mainit in Agusan del Norte. Similarities with the Cebuano language is undeniable, however, staunch Cebuano speakers can hardly understand people who speak Surigaonon. There is no doubt Surigaonon existed as pure and distinct, slowly pelted overtime by Visayan words as migrants settled in the area. Today, Surigaonon is the most widely spoken language inherent in the entire Caraga region.\nSurigaonon has similar consonant and vowel sounds, stress, intonation patterns to the Cebuano language and Boholano dialect. Surigaonon underwent certain morphophonemic processes, such as assimilation, deletion, alternation and metathesis (Dumanig, 2005). In the study conducted by Dumanig (2005) on Descriptive Analysis of Surigaonon language it was found that there are 18 consonants (b,d,g,h,j,k,l,m,n,ng,p,r,s,t,w,y,o,?) with 18 sounds and 3 vowels (a,i,u) with 5 sounds. It has also 25 consonant clusters (br, bl, bw, by, dr, dy, dw, gr, gw, kr, kl, kw, mw, my, nw, pr, pl, pw, py, sw, sy, tr, tw, ty, hw) and 4 diphthongs (aw, ay, iw, uy), which are similar to the Cebuano language (Rubrico, 1999). There are Surigaonon words that are spelled similarly but they differ in meaning depending on how each syllable is stressed (Dumanig, 2005). Surigaonon language follows two intonation patterns like the rising and falling intonation. The rising intonation is common in asking yes or no questions and the falling intonation occurs in ending declarative and imperative statements (Dumanig, 2005)\nSurigao City is governed via the mayor-council system. The city council, nationally called Sangguniang Panlungsod, consists of the vice mayor and 12 council members. The mayor is elected directly every three years.\nSurigao City is subdivided into 54 barangays, 33 in the mainland and 21 in the islands. Of the 36 coastal barangays, 15 are in the mainland and 20 are in the islands. The urban area covers 15 barangays or approximately 20% of the total land area. These include Taft, Washington, San Juan, Sabang, Canlanipa, Cagniog, Luna, Togbongon, Rizal, Ipil, Mabua, Lipata, Punta Bilar, Mabua and Ipil.\nSurigao City underwent rapid economic growth that spanned nearly two decades beginning in the late 1960s. Pacific Cement (PACEMCO) started commercial operations manufacturing Portland cement and the Canadian-owned company Marinduque Mining and Industrial Corporation (MMIC) also started extracting nickel and iron ore in Nonoc Island. This was a boon to the city as it generated commerce to meet increasing demand for goods and services. Towards the late 1970s, Surigao attained first class status. The rest of the province also saw increased mining operations, primarily extracting gold and copper. The city became the nexus of mining activity in the entire Northern Mindanao (Region X), at the time among Philippines' largest regions encompassing nearly half of Mindanao Island. Philippines' Bureau of Mines and Geosciences moved its regional headquarters in the city at Km. 1.\nIn 1983, MMIC ended commercial operations due to financial losses and heavy debt as a result of plummeting prices of nickel and high operating costs. Copra processing plant Surigao Coconut Development Corp. (SUCODECO) in Lipata also shut down. Surigao's weakened economy was further affected when typhoon Nitang (internationally codename Typhoon Ike) struck the city in September 1984. Seventy percent of the buildings and infrastructure were destroyed. Commercial activities declined, relying on basic services, small-scale industries, agriculture and fishing.\nFrom the mid 80s until the turn of the 21st century, Surigao's economic woes mirrored the rest of the nation as it saw some of its original families leave for opportunities in other places, both local and overseas. \nDuring the last decade, the city saw improvement of its key macroeconomic indicators. Increased retail activity was evident downtown as new stores opened and existing ones expanded. The success of major restaurant chains like Jollibee, Greenwich, Chowking (closed in 2014 but reopened in May 2016) and Mang Inasal opened the floodgates for more investments in the city. McDonald's also opened in March 2013 followed by Goldilocks in March 2015 and finally, the 2nd branch of Red Ribbon in June 2016. Hotel rooms doubled with the opening of new hotels and expansion of existing ones, with adequate convention facilities. Port expansion was completed in 2009, increasing its handling capacity. Today, it is one of the country's key seaports for gross registered tonnage handled, mainly from its mineral exports .\nThe city's primary agricultural produce includes rice, corn, vegetables, rootcrops, coconut, copra and bananas. It is a major supplier of fish and crustaceans; its exports reach buyers as far as Hong Kong, Japan and China. An integrated fishport is planned which includes functional facilities such as fish market, gear and commercial shops, administration building and fish container storage facilities.\nSurigao's retail activity is centered mainly around Luneta Park along the streets of San Nicolas, Borromeo and Rizal. A new uptown shopping district is developing in the city's Barangay Luna. Regional malls opened in early 2012 (one of which is Gaisano Capital Surigao, opened in December 2011). ParkWay Mall also opened in the last quarter of 2012 (including ParkWay Supermarket, opened in June 2013). CityMall will soon to open in the future started with the groundbreaking until its completion by 2017.\nNonoc Island has been identified as a special economic zone (Ecozone) by the national government, a boon older residents are quite familiar due to its once prosperous nickel ore production. This project is aimed to put the island's existing infrastructure, including a 1300-meter concrete airstrip and two 60,000 dwt seaport, back in operation. In 2005, China's Jinchuan Group Ltd. submitted a proposal to invest approximately US$1.0 billion for the rehabilitation and revival of the Nonoc nickel refinery. In 2010, Jinchuan renewed its interest in Nonoc, offering a bigger investment at $1.5 billion. However, its insistence for another feasibility study and disagreements over the operating structure shuttered the deal with Philnico who owns the mining rights for the island. In January 2012, San Miguel Corporation of the Philippines entered into a memorandum of agreement with the city government to rehabilitate and operate the Nonoc mines for $3 billion, the single biggest investment in the city yet.\nThe recent entry of major international mining company Sumitomo with $1.3 billion investment in the province sparked renewed interest of its vast mineral reserves and has helped spur secondary economic activities in the city. Other mining companies like Philex Mining Corporation , Mindoro Resources Ltd. and Anglo Ashanti are in various stages of exploration.\nTourism figures showed 200,000 foreign arrivals in the city in 2011, registering a 37% growth.\nAveraging a 21-ton daily collected garbage, the local government of Surigao built a sanitary landfill in Sitio Looc in 2009 under a PP150 million grant from the Swedish government and assistance from the Land Bank of the Philippines. It is considered a model for solid waste management which includes a P45 million-worth waste treatment facility, a material recovery facility which treats recyclables and a leachate collector, which extracts and treats liquids from garbage.\nSurigao Provincial Sports Complex, host to numerous national and regional events, underwent renovation in 2009 at a cost of PP320 million. The complex is situated on the 2-hectare Vasquez field and includes a 3500-person capacity grandstand, a fully air conditioned 3500 seating capacity gymnasium, a brand new amphitheater, an Olympic-size swimming pool and a fully rubberized track and field oval. Surigao Provincial Convention Center, also part of the complex, has a seating capacity of approximately 2500 persons.\nMotorized tricycles, an indigenous form of auto- rickshaw that can accommodate about six passengers, is mainly the mode of transport in the city. Buses and jeepneys follow fixed routes to outlying barangays, towns and neighboring provinces. The city is also served by outrigger water taxis called pump boats that follow scheduled sea routes to island barangays. Larger vessels called Lantsa have scheduled trips to Siargao, Dinagat and Bucas Grande. Regular ferry service connects the city to ports in Southern Leyte, Cebu, Manila and Agusan del Norte. There are direct flights to Manila and Cebu originating from the city's airport with occasional chartered flights to Siargao, Butuan and Tandag.\nHistoric Verano port completed a PP414 expansion and upgrade in 2009 to meet world standards and increased cargo demand from a revitalized mining industry in the province. Additional 2000 square meters of reclaimed area and 120 meters of berthing space were added. The port ranks as a major transshipment point in region.\nLipata Port and Ferry Terminal serves as the entry point to Mindanao Island forming part of the extensive Pan-Philippine Highway also called Maharlika Highway AH26 that originates from Laoag to its southern terminus in Zamboanga City. The port has ro-ro capabilities that provides regular service to the ports of Liloan and San Ricardo, both in Southern Leyte.\nPan- Philippine Highway AH26's northernmost terminus in Mindanao winds up in this city, dissecting the Surigao Valley before the Surigao-Davao Coastal Road spurs at Bad-as, Placer. An integrated bus and jeepney terminal serves companies with routes that reach major destinations including Ormoc, Tacloban, Legazpi, Manila, Butuan (change buses travel to Cagayan de Oro), Tandag, Davao, and Bislig (Mangagoy). Bus companies serving this terminal includes Bachelor Express, Philtranco, PP Bus Line and Surigao Express.\nClassified by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines as a principal domestic airport, Surigao Airport (SUG) is one of the two airports that serve the province of Surigao del Norte and northern parts of Surigao del Sur and Agusan del Norte. Cebgo and Airphil Express have regular scheduled flights from Surigao to Manila and Cebu. Small private planes operate chartered flights to Siargao's Sayak Airport. Due to increased passenger traffic and cargo, it is undergoing feasibility studies for future expansion to accommodate larger aircraft.\nCompleted in 2007, San Juan-Lipata Coastal Road connects the Port of Lipata to downtown Surigao, cutting the travel time in half. It includes a series of bridges across coastal barangays of San Juan and Sabang. The longest, Banahaw, spans the Surigao tidal basin.\nNew facilities built by leading telecommunication companies paved way for clear reception to other parts of the country and the rest of the world. The PLDT, Philippine Communications (PhilCom), Bayan Telecommunications (Bayantel), Sun Cellular, Globe Telecom and Smart Communications operate vital transmission towers in the city.\nOn February 11, 1997, the Congress of the Philippines enacted Republic Act 8244 converting Surigao Provincial Hospital into a regional training hospital and renamed it Caraga Regional Hospital, effectively expanding its scope and services that would include the entire Caraga region with a catchment population of nearly 2 million people. Today, this 150- bed tertiary hospital, a core referral facility, is rapidly expanding with intensive care units that includes Coronary, Pediatric, Surgical and Burn.\nIn October 2010, the city opened a PP35 million Drug Rehabilitation and Treatment Center in Anomar. Established under the aegis of the Department of Health, it is the first and only facility in the entire Caraga region solely focused on the treatment and rehabilitation of victims of substance abuse.\nOther hospitals in the city include Miranda Family Hospital and Surigao Medical Center.\nSurigao traces its roots to formal schooling in the year 1906 when the last group of Spanish Benedictine Missionaries, who had worked zealously to have founded the Cartilla or Doctrina School (Escuela Catolica de San Nicolas), vacated Surigao. Soon after their departure, the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart also known as the Dutch Fathers, succeeded them, created the parish of Surigao, and made the Escuela Catolica de San Nicolas a parochial school which later became San Nicolas College. In 2002, Surigao became the first urban center in the entire Caraga region to host a university after San Nicolas College changed its nomenclature to Saint Paul University Surigao, a part of Saint Paul University System.\nIn 1969, Surigao School of Arts and Trades was established on 1.2 hectares of land donated by the provincial government. It focused on curricula geared towards technology at a time the city saw rapid transformation with the onset of nickel exploration at the Nonoc island refinery. While the school was built, it initially held classes at the Provincial Sports Complex with a core census of 14 teachers and 103 students. In 1998, the school was renamed Surigao State College of Technology after it merged with Malimono School of Fisheries. On June 4, 2013, Surigao del Norte State University was established under Rep. Act 10600, integrating Surigao del Norte State College of Technology with Siargao National College of Science and Technology in Del Carmen and the Surigao del Norte College of Agriculture and Technology in Mainit.\nSan Sebastian College-Recoletos de Manila Institute of Law- Surigao Extension located in Taft opened in 1997.

The line was built from 1878\u201380. A more suitable name for a county seat was needed, and since George Mifflin Dallas was vice-president under James K. Polk, for whom the county was named, \"Dallas\" was a natural choice.\nDallas was incorporated as a town in 1874, and as a city in 1901. \nLouis Gerlinger, Sr. incorporated the Salem, Falls City and Western Railway Company late in October 1901 and announced plans to build a railroad from the Willamette River at Salem to the mouth of the Siletz River on the Oregon Coast, a distance of .\nIn 1902, Louis's son George T.

The town was named for Judge Alfred Burton Greenwood. Judge Greenwood had been elected the previous year to serve as Circuit Judge over ten Northwest Arkansas counties. The first court house was a log structure, replaced in 1865 by a frame court house which was built in the center of the public square. This courthouse later burned and in 1916 the courthouse was relocated south of the square. Since that time the square has become a city park and the site of many festivals, city picnics and celebrations.\nThe growth of Greenwood was comparatively slow, but by the breaking out of the Civil War it had attained some importance as a business center and by 1889 its business directory listed General Merchandise, Drugs, Groceries, Cotton Gin, Grist and Saw Mill, 3 Hotels, 3 Blacksmith and wood shops, 3 physicians, 1 dentist and 7 attorneys.\nGreenwood has withstood many economic changes and setbacks but perhaps its strongest test came when a devastating Tornado swept through the community in April 1968. There were 13 lives lost and countless businesses and homes destroyed.\nOne of the town's most famous sites is a park located in the center of town. Known as \"Town Square\", the area stands as a reminder of the past and a center for town activities.\nThe clock and bell tower that stands in the middle of town square was designed and built in 1976 in recognition of the United States' bicentennial. The bell tower houses the clock and bell that was once in the courthouse that was destroyed by the tornado. The clock and bell were used in the bell tower to recognize and remember the 13 who died during the tornado.\nThe square was the site for the Sebastian County Court House until 1916 when a new one was built across the street on the south side. The Greenwood Chamber of Commerce annual Freedomfest on July 4 takes place in the park as well as many other community gatherings.\nThe Historic City Square in downtown Greenwood, now known as Greenwood Veterans' Memorial Square, holds a memorial that honors the sacrifices of the uniformed service men and women. As a part of the Veterans' Memorial Square, there's a circle of stepping stones called the \"Patriot's Walk.\" Each stepping stone bears the name of a veteran on whose behalf families have contributed. The \"Patriot's Walk\" surrounds the city clock tower. The clock tower, erected in 1976, stands in the center of the memorial.\nGreenwood Veterans Memorial Square has become the recognized symbol of Greenwood. This small park area was once the site of the Sebastian County House, and the center of all business activity. When a new court house was built, the community turned the area into a green space. The Memorial has become the sight for community-wide activities such as the annual Freedom Fest celebration and Christmas parade.\nGreenwood's walking trail system weaves through the city and up to beautiful scenic views along the Promenade at Bell Park.

The Memorial is located Southeast of the Greenwood Townsquare on property donated by First National Bank and the Dr. James Burgess family. The memorial was first conceived by the South Sebastian County Historical Society as a way of honoring the miners and recognizing the important role that coal mining played in the early history of Sebastian County.\nThe Sebastian County Jail, located South of the Square in Greenwood, was built in 1892. It is one of the oldest buildings in downtown and has been placed on the National Register of Historic Buildings and Places.\nOld Jail Museum-\nThe stone for the building was quarried southwest of Greenwood, near old Highway 71, on Backbone Mountain. Holes were drilled in the stone on the mountain and left over the winter. As water filled the holes and froze, the pressure of the ice split the stone into manageable size. The stone was then transported to the building site by horse and wagon by Isaac Kunkel, stonemason, his son, Henry Oliver Kunkel, and his son-in-law, George Williamson. The men shaped the stone into building blocks and erected a four cell two story jail. The exterior and interior stone walls are two feet thick. Each cell in the jail had one entry. Four heavy iron doors were installed, one to each cell, from the outside. Inside of these doors another iron grid door was installed with a small pass-through opening it. Originally there was no access from cell to cell inside the building. The four outside doors are operational and can be used today. The original key to the outside doors continues to work in the lock although it is no longer used. The key is on display in the jail. The majority of the inmates were incarcerated for minor crimes such as rowdy behavior, drunkenness and theft. However several murderers were also housed in the jail. On occasion, when the mental hospital was full, the jail also housed mental patients. Visitors to the jail building who look carefully at the floors and walls will find messages scratched into the stone and cement by the inmates. At least two escapes from the jail are known to have happened. On escape was through the roof. Another time the prisoner made his escape and ran to his Jailer's home. He told the Jailer, \"I just can't stand the snakes any more.\" The building stood empty and idle for many years except when the city night watchman put some local resident in the jail overnight. In 1966, the jail building began to be used as a museum and repository for Sebastian County history.\nVineyard Cabin-\nThe Vineyard Cabin, originally located just west of Greenwood, was moved to the present location near the Old Jail Museum in Greenwood in 1994. Restoration of the cabin was completed in 1996. The cabin was a gift to the Sebastian County Historical Society from Suzanne Francis and Sandra Blackstock, granddaughters of former owners William and Mattie Vineyard. The circa 1848 cabin was built by a bachelor school teacher, William Blaylock. Mr. Blaylock first built a one-room cabin with a stone fireplace where he lived and taught school until his marriage in 1850. At that time, he added another similar room with a stone fireplace and connected the two rooms with a breezeway or dogtrot running the depth of the cabin.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 1994, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1994, "length": 1915, "sectionHeading": "Places to visit", "sectionLabel": "city.other"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3909, "length": 178, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4087, "length": 1615, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5702, "length": 300, "sectionHeading": "Government", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6002, "length": 3477, "sectionHeading": "Historic Greenwood", "sectionLabel": "city.other"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ogden,_Utah", "type": "city", "title": "North Ogden, Utah", "abstract": "North Ogden is a city in Weber County, Utah, United States.

The following year, after the trouble with the Shoshone had been partially settled, Jonathan Campbell returned with a number of other families to permanently settle the spot.\nOne important early industry in the mid to late 19th century was the sugar beet industry, and a processing and canning plant was built in the town for this. The owner of the canning plant during its operation was David Ephriam Randall. North Ogden also built a spur from the Union Pacific Station in Ogden, called the \"Dummy Line\". Large fruit orchards were developed and their harvest became an economic staple for the community, with the establishment of the North Ogden Fruit Exchange in 1924. This became the region's first fruit cooperative, using the railroad to sell fruit on the interstate market.\nIn the 1930s, increasing demand for water led the city to officially incorporate on February 1, 1934. David Gilbert Randall was elected the first mayor. He served in this position for ten years. That same decade saw the creation of the Cherry Days celebration on July 4. As North Ogden grew after World War II, it became a primary suburb for Ogden and other larger cities.

Males had a median income of $43,712 versus $28,180 for females. The per capita income for the city was $20,625. About 3.1% of families and 3.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.9% of those under age 18 and 3.1% of those age 65 or over.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 1603, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1603, "length": 255, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1858, "length": 1627, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester,_New_Hampshire", "type": "city", "title": "Manchester, New Hampshire", "abstract": "Manchester is the most populous city in the U.S. state of New Hampshire and the largest city in northern New England, an area comprising the states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 109,565, and its estimated 2016 population was 110,506. It is one of two seats of Hillsborough County (along with Nashua), the state of New Hampshire's most populous county. Manchester is located near the northern end of the Northeast megalopolis, along the banks of the Merrimack River\u2014which divides the city into eastern and western sections. It was first named by the merchant and inventor Samuel Blodgett (after whom Samuel Blodget Park and Blodget Street in Manchester's North End are named). Blodget's vision was to create a great industrial center similar to that of the original Manchester in England, which was the world's first industrialized city.\nManchester often appears favorably in lists ranking the affordability and livability of U.S. cities. In 2015, CNNMoney.com ranked it #1 in the U.S. for small businesses, and in 2009, another site ranked Manchester 13th in a list of the 100 best cities in the U.S. to live and launch a business. In addition, Kiplinger voted Manchester the second most tax-friendly city in the U.S., second only to Anchorage, Alaska. Also in 2009, Forbes magazine ranked the Manchester region first on its list of \"America's 100 Cheapest Places to Live.\" According to the Equality of Opportunity Project, released in 2013, Manchester ranked as the seventh best metropolitan area in the U.S. in terms of upward income mobility. In 2014, Forbes magazine ranked this city among the top 5 most educated cities in the United States.\n", "text": "Pennacook Indians called it Namaoskeag, meaning \"good fishing place\"\u2014a reference to the Amoskeag Falls in the Merrimack River. In 1722, John Goffe III settled beside Cohas Brook, later building a dam and sawmill at what was dubbed Old Harry's Town. It was granted by Massachusetts in 1727 as Tyngstown to veterans of Queen Anne's War who served in 1703 under Captain William Tyng. But at New Hampshire's 1741 separation from Massachusetts, the grant was ruled invalid and substituted with Wilton, Maine, so Governor Benning Wentworth rechartered the town in 1751 as \"Derryfield\". The rechartered name lives on in Derryfield Park and Derryfield Country Club, both on the east side of contemporary Manchester, and in the Derryfield School.\nIn 1807, Samuel Blodget opened a canal and lock system to allow vessels passage around the falls. He envisioned here a great industrial center, \"the Manchester of America\", like the Industrial Revolution's Manchester in England, the first industrialized city in the world. In 1809, Benjamin Prichard and others built a cotton spinning mill operated by water power on the western bank of the Merrimack. Following Blodgett's suggestion, Derryfield was renamed Manchester in 1810, the year the mill was incorporated as the Amoskeag Cotton & Woolen Manufacturing Company. It would be purchased in 1825 by entrepreneurs from Massachusetts, expanded to 3 mills in 1826, and then incorporated in 1831 as the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company.\nOn the eastern bank, Amoskeag engineers and architects planned a model company town, founded in 1838 with Elm Street as its main thoroughfare. Incorporated as a city in 1846, Manchester would become home to the largest cotton mill in the world\u2014Mill No. 11, stretching long by wide, and containing 4,000 looms. Other products made in the community included shoes, cigars, and paper. The Amoskeag foundry made rifles, sewing machines, textile machinery, fire engines, and locomotives in a division called the Amoskeag Locomotive Works (later, the Manchester Locomotive Works). The rapid growth of the mills demanded a large influx of workers, resulting in a flood of immigrants, particularly French Canadians. Many current residents descend from these workers. The Amoskeag Manufacturing Company went out of business in 1935, although its red brick mills have been renovated for other uses. Indeed, the mill town's 19th-century affluence left behind some of the finest Victorian commercial, municipal, and residential architecture in the state.\nManchester is in south-central New Hampshire, south of Concord, the state capital, and the same distance north of Nashua, the second-largest city in the state. Manchester is north-northwest of Boston, the largest city in New England.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water, comprising 5.33% of the city. Manchester is drained by the Merrimack River and its tributaries the Piscataquog River and Cohas Brook. Massabesic Lake is on the eastern border. The highest point in Manchester is atop Wellington Hill, where the elevation reaches above sea level.\nThe Manchester Planning Board, in its 2010 Master Plan, defines 25 neighborhoods within the city. LivableMHT has drawn maps of the neighborhoods and neighborhood village centers as defined by the city. Recognition of particular neighborhoods varies, with some having neighborhood associations, but none have any legal or political authority.\nThe major neighborhoods, historically, include Amoskeag, Rimmon Heights, Notre Dame/McGregorville and Piscataquog/Granite Square also known as \"Piscat\" on the West Side; and the North End, Janeville/Corey Square, Hallsville and Bakersville on the East Side; along with Youngsville and Goffes Falls on the periphery of the city.\nIn 2007, the city began a Neighborhood Initiatives program to \"insure that our neighborhoods are vibrant, livable areas since these are the portions of the city where most of the residents spend their time living, playing, shopping and going to school.\" The purpose of this initiative is to foster vibrancy and redevelopment in the neighborhoods, and to restore the sense of neighborhood communities that had been overlooked in the city for some time. The city began the program with street-scape and infrastructure improvements in the Rimmon Heights neighborhood of the West Side, which has spurred growth and investment in and by the community. Despite the success of the program in Rimmon Heights, it was unclear in recent years how the city planned to implement similar programs throughout the city. The city announced plans for extending the Neighborhood Initiatives program to the Hollow neighborhood in February 2012.\nThe urban core of Manchester extends beyond its city limits in several directions, particularly west and south of downtown, including:\n- Pinardville \u2013 In the town of Goffstown, Pinardville is a fairly dense, former streetcar suburb along Mast Road to the west of Manchester. It is home to Saint Anselm College.\n- River Corridor \u2013 In the town of Bedford, the River Corridor is a mid-density, primarily shopping district along South River Road about two-and-a-half miles from downtown Manchester. The area has recently implemented Tax Increment Financing to improve and maintain infrastructure, and the Town of Bedford's most recent master plan has called for increasing mixed-use development and promoting walkability and transit use, though the Manchester Transit Authority bus service in the area was recently curtailed following a decision by the Town of Bedford to discontinue funding service.\n- Northeast Bedford \u2013 The northeast section of Bedford is a mainly low to mid-density suburban residential area near the terminus of the former St. Joseph's streetcar line along Donald Street and post-war development along Boynton Street, with some businesses scattered throughout. The area does not have a formal name, but the section along Boynton Street has variously been called the Plains and the Pines. The northern area is more rural with large portions owned by Saint Anselm College.\n- South Hooksett \u2013 The southeastern portion of the town of Hooksett is a sprawling, suburban shopping area north of Manchester.\n- Manchester\u2013Boston Regional Airport near the city's southeastern corner, and the surrounding industrial areas extend into neighboring Londonderry.\nManchester has a four-season humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfa), with long, cold, snowy winters, and very warm and somewhat humid summers; spring and fall in between are crisp and relatively brief transitions. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from in January to in July. On average, there are 11 days of highs at or above and 3.0 days of lows at or below annually. Precipitation is well-spread throughout the year, though winter is the driest season while March tends to be the wettest. Record temperatures range from on February 16, 1943, up to on July 22, 2011.\nThe city is the center of the Manchester, New Hampshire, New England City and Town Metropolitan Area (NECTA MA), which had a population of 187,596 as of the 2010 census. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 109,565, and its 2015 population estimate was 110,229. The Manchester-Nashua metropolitan area, with an estimated population in 2015 of 406,678, is home to nearly one-third of the population of New Hampshire.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 109,565 residents, 45,766 households, and 26,066 families in the city. The population density was 3,320.2 people per square mile (1,281.5/km\u00b2). There were 49,288 housing units at an average density of 1,493.6 per square mile (576.5/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the city was 86.1% White, 4.1% Black or African American, 0.30% Native American, 3.7% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 3.1% from some other race, and 2.7% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 8.1% of the population. Non-Hispanic Whites were 82.0% of the population, down from 98.0% in 1980.\nIn 2011 the largest ancestry groups within the city's population were: French and French-Canadian (23.9%), Irish (19.5%), English (9.9%), German (8.6%), and Italian (8.1%).\nAt the 2010 census, there were 45,766 households, out of which 26.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.4% were married couples living together, 13.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 43.0% were non-families. 32.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.34 persons and the average family size was 2.99.\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 21.6% under the age of 18, 10.2% from 18 to 24, 30.4% from 25 to 44, 26.0% from 45 to 64, and 11.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36.0 years. For every 100 females there were 98.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.6 males.\nIn 2011 the estimated median income for a household in the city was $51,082, and the median income for a family was $63,045. Male full-time workers had a median income of $43,583 versus $37,155 for females. The per capita income for the city was $26,131. 14.1% of the population and 9.6% of families were below the poverty line. Out of the total people living in poverty, 21.8% were under the age of 18 and 9.9% were 65 or older.\nManchester is northern New England's largest city, and as of the 2014 U.S. Census population estimate was the most populous New England city north of Boston, including other Massachusetts cities. Its metropolitan area is one of the fastest growing in New England. Its economy has changed greatly, as Manchester was a textile mill town about 40 years ago. In March 2009, Kiplinger voted Manchester the second most tax friendly city in the U.S., after Anchorage, Alaska. Earlier in the year, CNN rated Manchester 13th in its top 100 best places in the U.S. to live and launch a business. Manchester is nicknamed the Queen City, as well as the more recently coined \"Manch Vegas\". In 1998, Manchester was named the \"Number One Small City in the East\" by Money magazine. The Mall of New Hampshire, on Manchester's southern fringe near the intersection of Interstates 93 and 293, is the city's main retail center. In 2001, the Verizon Wireless Arena, a venue seating more than 10,000, opened for major concerts and sporting events, enhancing the city's downtown revitalization efforts with a major hotel and convention center already in place directly across the street from the arena. The building was renamed the SNHU Arena in 2016.\nManchester is the home of Segway, Inc., manufacturers of a two-wheeled, self-balancing electric vehicle invented by Dean Kamen.\nDowntown Manchester's One City Hall Plaza stands 22 stories high, quickly followed by the all-black, 20-story Brady Sullivan Plaza, formerly known as the Hampshire Plaza. They are the tallest New England buildings north of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Sullivan Plaza is shorter than City Hall Plaza by a mere . Other major buildings include the 18-story Wall Street Apartments tower; the 14-story, recently renamed Brady Sullivan Tower, which was the former New Hampshire Insurance building; at 12 stories, the Radisson Hotel and Convention Center Manchester (which serves the SNHU Arena across the street), the Carpenter Center (a former hotel), and the Hampshire Towers condominium building; the 10-story Citizens Bank Building, which was, for much of the early- and mid-20th century, Manchester's iconic Amoskeag Bank \"skyscraper\"; and several high-rises of or exceeding 10 stories on the city's West Side. This partial list only includes residential and commercial buildings and does not include hospitals, spires and domes, etc.\nThe SNHU Arena has become the centerpiece of downtown Manchester. The venue can seat slightly less than 12,000 patrons for concerts, and at least 10,000-seat configurations for sporting and other forms of entertainment. The arena is home to the Manchester Monarchs, the local ECHL affiliate of the Los Angeles Kings. It has also hosted major recording artists and comedians, national touring theatrical productions, family-oriented shows, and fairs since it opened in 2001. The Northeast Delta Dental Stadium (formerly MerchantsAuto.com Stadium) is a baseball park located on the Merrimack River in downtown Manchester and is home to the local AA baseball affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, the New Hampshire Fisher Cats. Historic Gill Stadium supported professional minor-league baseball into the early 21st century and continues to be a viable and popular downtown venue for many sporting and entertainment events, seating nearly 4,000 patrons, depending on the event format.\nIn recent years there has been continual redevelopment of the Amoskeag Millyard and its residential Historic District. The increasing popularity of downtown living has caused many properties originally built as tenement housing for mill workers in the 19th century to be converted to stylish, eclectic residential condominiums. Many new retail stores and higher education institutions, including the University of New Hampshire at Manchester, have been uniquely retro-fitted into properties along Commercial and Canal Street.\nManchester has three main retail areas: downtown Manchester, South Willow Street (NH Route 28), and Second Street (NH Route 3A) on the West Side. The Mall of New Hampshire is located on South Willow Street, and, with more than 125 stores, is one of the largest shopping centers in southern New Hampshire and central New England.\nCultural landmarks include the historic Palace Theatre, the Currier Museum of Art, the New Hampshire Institute of Art, the Franco-American Center, the Manchester Historic Association Millyard Museum, the Massabesic Audubon Center, the Amoskeag Fishways Learning and Visitors Center, the Lawrence L. Lee Scouting Museum and Max I. Silber Library, and the SEE Science Center. Valley Cemetery, the resting place of numerous prominent citizens since 1841, is an early example of a garden-style burial ground.\nThe John F. Kennedy Memorial Coliseum is another, smaller venue located in downtown Manchester with a capacity of approximately 3,000 seats. It was completed in 1963, serves as home ice for the Manchester Central and Memorial High School hockey teams, and is home to the Southern New Hampshire Skating Club.\nThe nickname \"ManchVegas\" was derived from illegal gambling in local businesses during the late 1980s or early 1990s. Many pizza shops and local bars had video poker machines that would pay out real money. The nickname was coined following a citywide bust of these machines. It was then adopted as a lampoon of the city's limited entertainment opportunities. The term has since become a source of pride as the city's entertainment scene has grown. By 2003 it was well enough known that a note on Virtualtourist.com said, \"Residents reflect the regional dry humor by referring to sedate Manchester as 'ManchVegas'.\" By 2005, an article in Manchester's Hippo (a local alternative weekly) said that then-Mayor Robert A. Baines \"is pushing to replace the nickname ManchVegas with Manchhattan\" (meaning Manchester+Manhattan). In 2009 the film Monsters, Marriage and Murder in ManchVegas was released referencing Manchester's popular nickname and using much of the city as its backdrop.\nManchester has a growing collective of artists, due in large part to the influx of young students at the New Hampshire Institute of Art, Southern New Hampshire University, and the University of New Hampshire at Manchester. Slam Free or Die, New Hampshire's only weekly slam poetry venue, is located in Manchester and was voted \"Best Poetry Venue in the World\" by readers of Write Bloody Publishing.\nThe Manchester City Library has served the city's residents since the mid-1850s and has been housed in the Carpenter Memorial Building on Pine Street since 1914. There is a branch location on North Main Street on the West Side\nThe city is home to McIntyre Ski Area, which opened in 1971. There are also college sports teams that play in and out of the city.\nManchester is the only city in New Hampshire with professional sports teams. The SNHU Arena is home to the ECHL's Manchester Monarchs. From 2001 to 2015, Manchester had a team, also called the Manchester Monarchs, that played in the American Hockey League. In their final season in Manchester, the Monarchs won the league championship. Northeast Delta Dental Stadium is home to the two-time Eastern League champions, the New Hampshire Fisher Cats. The following is a list of Manchester's professional and minor-league sports teams.\nManchester has several sports leagues.\nFor baseball, until 2007, there were six Little Leagues:\n- Manchester East Little League\n- Manchester West Little League\n- Manchester North Little League\n- Manchester South Little League\n- Manchester Central Little League\n- Manchester Southwest Little League\nIn 2007, due to declining numbers, West and Southwest consolidated into one league to form Manchester West Side Little League, and Manchester South and Manchester West Side Little Leagues merged in 2017 to become Manchester Little League. In the summer of 2015, Manchester East switched affiliation to the Cal Ripken Baseball League, a division of Babe Ruth Baseball. The league is now known as Manchester Cal Ripken.\nAs of 2017, the options for youth baseball include Manchester Cal Ripken for all youths 12 and under in Manchester, and:\n- Manchester Little League\n- Manchester North Little League\n- Manchester Central Little League\nYouths wishing to play in these leagues must reside within the respective leagues' approved boundaries.\nThere are four fall-season soccer leagues:\n- Manchester South Junior Soccer League\n- Manchester North Soccer League\n- Manchester Junior Soccer League West\n- Manchester East Soccer League\nManchester Angels Youth Soccer League is a spring-only league.

Kennedy Memorial Coliseum.\nYouth football organizations in Manchester include:\n- Manchester Eagles (Pop Warner)\n- Manchester East Cobras (AYF)\n- Manchester South Sabers (AYF)\n- Manchester West Raiders (AYF)\n- Manchester Bears (NEJHFL)\n- Manchester Flag Football League\nThere are many other youth sports opportunities in Manchester, including AAU baseball and basketball as well as CYO basketball.\nMcIntyre Ski Area is home to the McIntyre Ski Team, which is a member of NHARA and USSA.\nA club for a \"sport for the mind\" called FIRST is based in Manchester. The 3 high schools (4 including Manchester School of Technology) each have one team apiece: Manchester High School Central has FRC Team 131, CHAOS; Manchester Memorial High School has FRC Team 238, the Crusaders (named for the school mascot); Manchester High School West has FRC Team 501, the Power Knights (also named for the school mascot); and Manchester School of Technology has FRC Team 6763, Fusion (rookie year 2017). \nManchester is incorporated as a city under the laws of the State of New Hampshire, and operates under a strong mayoral form of government. The mayor serves as chairman of the fourteen-member Board of Mayor and Aldermen, the city's legislative body. Each of Manchester's twelve wards elects a single alderman, and two additional at-large members are elected citywide.\nThe mayor also serves as the chair of the board of school committee. Like the board of aldermen, the school board has twelve members elected by ward and two at-large members. The School Board is not a city department; rather, it is a school district coterminous with the city, which obtains financing from the Board of Mayor and Aldermen.\nManchester's public school system is run by the Manchester School District.\nManchester School District has four public high schools:\n- Manchester High School West\n- Manchester High School Central\n- Manchester Memorial High School\n- Manchester School of Technology\nManchester School District has four public middle schools and fourteen elementary schools.\nManchester is served by three private high schools:\n- Trinity High School, a private, Roman Catholic high school\n- The Derryfield School, a private school serving sixth through twelfth grades\n- Holy Family Academy, a small Roman Catholic private school serving seventh through twelfth grades\nIn addition:\n- Mount Zion Christian Schools, a non-denominational, evangelical Christian school serving kindergarten through twelfth grade\n- The Founders Academy, a charter school that began in the 2014\u201315 school year for children in 6th to 12th grades\n- Saint Benedict Academy, a Catholic elementary school serving kindergarten through sixth grade (formerly Saint Raphael School and Westside Regional Catholic School)\n- Robert B. Jolicoeur School, a private special education school\n- St Anthony's School, a K\u20136 Catholic elementary school\n- St Casimir School, a K\u20138 Polish Catholic school\n- St. Catherine of Siena School, a pre-K to 6th grade parochial elementary school.\n- St. Joseph Regional Junior High School, a grade 7-8 regional Catholic junior high school\nArea institutions of higher education, together enrolling more than 8,000 students, include:\n- Franklin Pierce University at Manchester\n- Granite State College \u2013 Manchester\n- Hellenic American University\n- Manchester Community College\n- Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences \u2013 Manchester, New Hampshire Secondary Campus\n- New Hampshire Institute of Art (formerly called the Manchester Institute of Arts and Sciences)\n- Saint Anselm College, located in the Pinardville neighborhood of the adjacent town of Goffstown, but with a Manchester mailing address and telephone exchange\n- Southern New Hampshire University, located on the boundary between Manchester and Hooksett\n- Springfield College Manchester\n- University of New Hampshire at Manchester\nThe city is served by the New Hampshire Union Leader (formerly the Manchester Union Leader), The Hippo, the Manchester Mirror and the Manchester Ink Link.\nThe city is home to the following FM radio stations:\n- WDER-FM 92.1 (Christian preaching)\n- Hot Hits 94.1 (top 40)\n- WZID 95.7 (adult contemporary)\n- WMLL 96.5 (classic hits)\n- WOKQ 97.5 (country music)\n- WGIR-FM 101.1 (rock music)\n- WFNQ 106.3 (classic rock)\nManchester is on the northern edge of the Boston television market.\nThe city is served by Manchester-Boston Regional Airport, the fourth-largest passenger and third-largest cargo airport in New England.\nInterstates 93 and 293 and the F.E. Everett Turnpike are multi-lane highways that connect the metropolitan area to Concord and the White Mountains to the north and Nashua and Boston to the south. NH 101 is a four-lane highway eastbound from Manchester to Hampton Beach, connecting the city with the southeastern part of the state and the seacoast, as well as Maine and the Massachusetts North Shore via Interstate 95. West of Manchester, NH 101 is a two-lane highway serving as the main artery to Keene, the Monadnock region, and other points in southwestern New Hampshire, eventually connecting to NH 9 and the state's border with Vermont. U.S. Route 3 and state routes 3A, 28, 28A, and Bypass 28 also flow through the city.\nA direct highway access with the airport connects the Everett Turnpike just south of the city with the Manchester-Boston Regional Airport via a Merrimack River-crossing connector road known as Raymond Wieczorek Drive (in honor of a former Manchester mayor instrumental in getting the access road built). The connector road also intersects with highways U.S. 3 and NH 3A.\nPublic transportation is provided by the Manchester Transit Authority, which runs several bus routes throughout the city and surrounding areas. Concord Trailways and Boston Express run commuter services to Boston and other parts of the state. Vermont Transit Lines (affiliated with Greyhound Lines) has lines to Montreal. In 2008, Boston Express moved to suburb Londonderry, New Hampshire, and now provides only limited service to downtown Manchester.\nThe possibility of Manchester being served by the Capital Corridor, an extension of the MBTA commuter rail from its current terminus in Lowell, Massachusetts, to Concord, which would also include a stop at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport, is being studied by the New Hampshire Rail Transit Authority and New Hampshire Department of Transportation, which have received federal funding for studying and planning the route. The Capital Corridor route is also being studied as a possible future high-speed rail line connecting Montreal and Boston. Currently, the Manchester-Nashua area is one of the 40 largest metropolitan areas in the United States without Amtrak service.\nWith the expansion of Interstate 93 to eight lanes from Salem to Manchester under construction, space is being reserved in the median for potential future commuter or light rail service along this corridor. The I-93 transit study also suggested restoring service on the Manchester and Lawrence branch for commuter and freight rail. This corridor would support freight rail along with commuter, something that light rail cannot do.\nIn late 2011, Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway and owner of several buildings in the Millyard, as well as co-founder of FIRST, proposed a rail loop for downtown and the Millyard. Several meetings have been held with area business and property owners, city officials and local developers, but the idea is in the early conceptual stages.\nThe downtown rail loop, if approved by the Board of Mayor and Aldermen, would be about three miles long. The loop would go from the Manchester Millyards, down south for about half a mile, then turn over Elm Street, separate into two rails (the other going towards Manchester-Boston Regional Airport), and climb north to Bridge Street and up to the New Hampshire Tower, where it ends.\nLaw enforcement is provided by the Manchester Police Department. The Manchester police station is currently located at 405 Valley Street on the corner of Valley and Maple.\nThe Hillsborough County Department of Corrections is located at 445 Willow Street. The prison houses an average of 500 inmates.\nThe city of Manchester is protected all year by the 258 paid, professional firefighters of the city of Manchester Fire Department.

As of the 2010 census, the population was 17,411. The Bureau of Economic Analysis combines the City of Colonial Heights (along with the City of Petersburg) with Dinwiddie County for statistical purposes.\nColonial Heights is located in the Tri-Cities area of the Richmond Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).\n", "text": "Like much of eastern Virginia, the site of Colonial Heights was located within the Algonquian-speaking confederation known as Tenakomakah, ruled by Chief Powhatan, when the English colonists arrived at Jamestown on May 14, 1607. Captain John Smith's early map of Virginia testifies that the present area of Colonial Heights included the principal town of the Appamattuck subtribe, led by their weroance, Coquonasum, and his sister, Oppussoquionuske. In the aftermath of the Indian attacks of 1622 and 1644, the Appamattuck became tributary to England and relocated to nearby Ettrick, and its opposite bank, near Fort Henry (within modern-day Petersburg, Virginia).\nThe area including present-day Colonial Heights was made a part of \"Henrico Cittie\", one of 4 huge \"incorporations\" formed in the Virginia Colony in 1619 by the London Company. English colonists first settled in the Colonial Heights area in 1620. A small group sailed up the Appomattox River looking for clear land, and finally settled in an area where Swift Creek runs into the Appomattox River, which they named Conjurer's Neck. This confluence was formerly the residence of a Native American healer (known as a \"conjurer\") who was thought to have cast spells over the waters.\nShortly thereafter, Charles Magnor registered the first land patent in the area for , which he later developed into a plantation before selling it in 1634. That same year, by order of King Charles I of England, the Virginia Colony was divided into the 8 original shires of Virginia by the House of Burgesses, one of which was Henrico County, which included the future land of Colonial Heights.\nIn 1635, the English had a small town called Appamattucks near the \"Old Towne\" Creek, thought to be located near the intersection of Temple Avenue and Dimmock Parkway. Also in that year, Captain Henry Fleet and Francis Poythress built a small fort nearby, on \"Fleet's Hill\" just west of the current city, now occupied by the campus of Virginia State University.\nDuring the period from 1677 to 1685, one of the area's historic landmarks was constructed with the building of the Old Brick House. Richard Kennon came to Virginia prior to 1670, and became a merchant of Bermuda Hundred. He represented Henrico County in the House of Burgesses. His son, Richard Kennon, Jr., was also a member of the House of Burgesses and married the daughter of Col. Robert Bolling, the emigrant, and his second wife, the former Anne Stith. Richard's sister, Mary Kennon, was married to Major John Fairfax Bolling, half-brother of Richard's wife. Major Bolling was the son of Col. Robert Bolling and his first wife Jane Rolfe, who was granddaughter of the early colonist John Rolfe and his Native American wife, Pocahontas. The Bollings lived at Cobb's, a plantation in eastern Chesterfield near Point-of-Rocks.\nThe plantation house built by Richard Kennon (later known as the \"Brick House\") is now thought to be the oldest permanent structure in Colonial Heights. One wall of the house survived a disastrous fire in 1879, and the rest was rebuilt. \nIn 1749, an area south of the James River was divided from Henrico County by the House of Burgesses, and named Chesterfield County. The area which became Colonial Heights was to remain in Chesterfield County for almost 200 more years, until 1948.\nThe name \"Colonial Heights\" results from an incident during the American Revolutionary War. In May 1781, the French troops of General Marquis de Lafayette, known as the Coloniels, advanced south from Richmond and deployed artillery on the heights overlooking Petersburg from across the Appomattox River. The area thereafter came to be known as \"Colonial Heights\", and the name was given to a subdivision of the Oak Hill tract in 1906.\nA historic site, Oak Hill, on Carroll Avenue, also called Archer's, Hector's, or Dunn's Hill, consisted of two one-story weatherboarded structures connected by a deep inside porch that extends from an uncovered section toward the street. From the lawn of this house, in May 1781, General Lafayette \u2014 with cannon behind a boxwood hedge that still fringes the hill \u2014 shelled Petersburg, then occupied by British troops under Major-General William Phillips (who died of typhoid during this bombardment).\nThe area also became involved in operations during the American Civil War. General Robert E. Lee made his headquarters at Violet Bank from June through September during the Siege of Petersburg in 1864.\nIn 1926, Colonial Heights became an incorporated town in Chesterfield County. Originally seeking to be annexed by the City of Petersburg, in the face of overwhelming public support, a judges ruling instead saw Colonial Heights designated an incorporated town. \nIt was incorporated as a city in 1948; under Virginia law, it separated from Chesterfield County and became an independent city. Its current charter was granted in 1960. From 1960 to 1970, Colonial Heights experienced a period of rapid growth as the population jumped from 9,587 to 15,097.\nIn the mid-1980s, completion of the State Route 144 (Temple Avenue Connector) and a new bridge across the Appomattox River provided access to State Route 36 near Fort Lee. The new road and bridge effectively opened a large previously isolated tract of land along the southeastern edge of the city for commercial development. There, the regional Southpark Mall and many other retail businesses and offices were built.\nOn August 6, 1993, an F4 tornado (max. wind speeds 207-260 mph) passed through Colonial Heights. It caused extensive damage to the Southpark Mall and collapsed the roof of an old Wal Mart (now Sam's Club) store. It also did extensive damage in Petersburg and Hopewell. In the Tri-Cities area, the tornado killed 4 people (3 in Wal-Mart & 1 in Prince George), injured 246, and caused an estimated $50 million in property damage.\nOn April 28, 2008, an EF1 tornado (max. wind speeds 86-110 mph) produced a near two mile (3 km) long, though discontinuous, path through Colonial Heights. The tornado first touched down near the Colonial Heights Middle School football field, damaging the field clubhouse roof, then causing roof damage and spill onto I-95 from Medallion Pool business. The tornado then jumped I-95 and touched down again in the Dimmock Square Shopping Center. Several cars were flipped and piled in the parking lot of a strip mall (which had extensive roof damage) that is less than a tenth of a mile from the site of the old Wal Mart which was destroyed by an F4 tornado on August 6, 1993. The tornado then continued across Temple Avenue, causing tree and roof damage in the neighborhood near Fine Drive and Puddledock Road (in Prince George County) before lifting for good. The tornado injured 21 and caused an estimated $10 million in property damage.\nTwo area attractions with historic roots are Violet Bank and Swift Creek Mill. There are also several parks in the area, including Fort Clifton Park and White Bank Park.\nColonial Heights is also home of the largest Arby's restaurant in the world.\nColonial Heights is located at (37.262257, -77.402728).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and of it (3.7%) is water.\nColonial Heights is located on just north of the Appomattox River across from the modern-day City of Petersburg at the river's fall line It is located south of Chesterfield County (practically surrounded by it except for a south border with Petersburg) and in some areas, Swift Creek divides the city from the county.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 16,897 people, 7,027 households, and 4,722 families residing in the city.

Located in the Ozark Mountains foothills, the city is part of the Tulsa Metropolitan Area and home to Rogers State University. It is best known as the birthplace and home of early 20th-century entertainer Will Rogers.\nThis area was part of the territory of the Osage, but they were forced out under a treaty with the United States. During the Indian Removal period and until statehood, this area was a reserve of the Cherokee Nation, which had been removed from its territory in the Southeast United States. This was within what was known as the Cherokee Cooweescoowee District.\n", "text": "Around 1802, bands of Osage Indians settled in this area of what is now northeastern Oklahoma. Black Dog was the chief of a band that settled at Pasona, where the city of Claremore later developed. He shared power with chiefs Clermont (aka Claremore), and Pawhuska. Clermont, named by French traders, settled with his band in a village known as Pasuga, meaning \"Big Cedar\", which was located on an ancient platform earthwork mound in this area. \nThe Osage village of Pasuga was destroyed by Cherokee in June 1817, during the Battle of Claremore Mound, also known as the Battle of the Strawberry Moon. These Western Cherokee had moved into the region from the southeastern United States and were perpetually competing with the Osage, who looked down on them. At the time of the attack, most of the men were out of the villages to hunt bison on the plains. The Cherokee killed the men in the village, and took more than 100 women and children captive, selling them to eastern Cherokee. Accounts differ as to whether chief Clermont was killed in the raid.\nAfter the Indian Removal Act of 1830 was passed by Congress, this area was designated as part of Indian Territory and the Cherokee Nation were assigned much of this territory.

He and other members of his family were buried at the Will Rogers Memorial.\nA post office was established on June 25, 1874. The coming of railways to Indian Territory was the driving factor in Claremore's early growth. Two early lines intersected in the center of town. The town changed the spelling of its name from Clermont to Claremore on September 19, 1882. A clerk recording the town as having a post office had spelled the name incorrectly, and it stuck.

They believed bathing in such springs to have medical benefits. George Eaton had settled with his family in the Claremore area in 1874, and conducted farming and cattle raising. He later branched into the mercantile business, real estate, and oil exploration. While drilling just east of Claremore in 1903, Easton struck an underground pool of water that smelled of sulfur. Local physician Dr. W. G. Williams tested the water and marketed it as a cure. Known as \"Radium Water\", it contained no radium, but hydrogen sulfide and sulfur compounds that were believed to make it medically useful. Eaton built a bath house and promoted the pool area as Radium Town. Radium Town was centered on 9th Street between Seminole and Dorothy. Bath houses were built by promoters all over this area of Claremore, and for a time attracted travelers and tourists for the waters. Only one was still standing as of 2008.\nClaremore's first hospital was established in the early 1900s along what is now known as Will Rogers Boulevard, or Oklahoma State Highway 20.

The site was originally on the banks of Clear Branch. The Masonic lodge hall and a log schoolhouse were the first public buildings. The post office was established in 1859. The First Presbyterian Church of Clifton was organized in 1861 and is the county's oldest church in continuous service. The Baptists built the first church building in Clifton in 1884-85. After the Civil War, Joel Martin Stinnett (1806-1875), the grandfather of Joseph Kemp, built a flour mill powered by the Bosque River. In 1868, this mill was replaced by a limestone mill, which was converted to the electric power plant that provided the first electricity for Clifton homes and businesses. A three-story school known as Rock School was built about 1870 and served the community for more than twenty years. In 1893, a new building was constructed on property donated to the Clifton school system.\nIn 1880 the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway built a station a mile south of Clifton. Merchants moved their businesses closer to the railroad station, and the town thrived as a business and trade center. The Merchant Exchange and Flour Mill, the first steam flour mill in the Bosque valley, was established in 1887 or 1888. The Clifton Record, a newspaper that began publishing in 1895 under the ownership of W. C. O'Brian, continued to serve the community. Clifton served as the county seat between 1890 and 1892. Clifton Lutheran College, later known as Clifton College, opened in 1896. The community was incorporated in 1901.

A fire on December 23, 1906, destroyed a large portion of the business district, which was eventually rebuilt. The Clifton Volunteer Fire Department was organized in 1907. The town's need for a hospital was met by Dr. V. D. Goodall and Dr. S. L. Witcher, who formed the Goodall-Withcher Hospital in 1938, which is still operating today along with the Clifton Clinic. The Lutheran Sunset Home for the elderly was established in Clifton in 1954. In 1991, the Bosque River flooded much of the town due to torrential rains.

Sites along the route include many 19th century homes and churches. Among them is Our Savior's Lutheran Church, which was established in 1869. The church is the annual site of the Norse Smorgasbord, a feast of traditional foods introduced to the area by Norwegian settlers. Further down the road a Lutefisk dinner is held annually in Cranfills Gap, near the site of the historic St. Olaf Kirke, often called the Old Rock Church.\nClifton celebrates its Norwegian heritage each year with the Norwegian Country Christmas Tour, held the first Saturday of December.

Its terrain is mixture of swamp and prairie.\nIn the 16th century, the area between the Atchafalaya River, in Louisiana, the Gulf of Mexico and Trinity River, in Texas, was occupied by numerous Indians tribes or subdivisions of the Attakapan people. The Indian Territory was not closed to outsiders, and several traders roamed through it on business. Europeans did not begin to settle there until French explorers claimed and \"founded\" Louisiana in 1699. They referred to the territory between the Atchafalaya River and Bayou Nezpique, where the Eastern Atakapa lived, as the Attakapas Territory, adopting the name from the Choctaw language term for this people. The French colonial government gave land away to soldiers and settlers.\nAttakapas Post was founded as a trading post on the banks of the Bayou Teche, and settlers started to arrive. Some came separately from France, such as M. Masse, who came about 1754 from Grenoble. Gabriel Fuselier de la Claire, a Frenchman from Lyon, and some other Frenchmen from Mobile, in present-day Alabama, arrived in late 1763/early 1764. Fuselier bought land between Vermilion River and Bayou Teche from the Eastern Attakapas chief Kinemo. Shortly after that, the rival Appalousa (Opelousa people) invaded the area via the Atchafalaya and Sabine rivers, and exterminated much of the Eastern Atakapan. Gabriel Fuselier's son Agricole Fuselier was prominent in settling what developed as New Iberia, Louisiana.\nGradually groups of more French speakers arrived, such as the first Acadians from Nova Scotia. They were assigned to this area in 1765 by Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie, the French official who was administering Louisiana for the Spanish. They had been expelled from Acadia by the British, who had defeated France in the Seven Years' War and taken over its territories in North America east of the Mississippi River. Spain took over Louisiana and other territories west of the Mississippi but tended to rely on French colonists to administer La Louisiane.\nThe Acadians were led by Joseph Broussard dit Beausoleil. In 1768-1769 fifteen families arrived from Pointe Coupee, another French colonial community. Their members had migrated from Santo Domingo (French Saint Domingue, today Ha\u00efti) or from Paris via Fort de Chartres, Illinois. Between the arrivals of the two groups, the French captain Etienne de Vaugine came in 1764 and acquired a large domain east of Bayou Teche.\nOn April 25, 1766, after the arrival of the first Acadians, the census showed a population of 409 inhabitants for the Attakapas region. In 1767 the Attakapas Post had 150 inhabitants before the arrival of the 15 families from Pointe Coupee. \nIn 1803, after losing his effort to regain control over Saint-Domingue, Napoleon sold Louisiana in 1803 to the United States through the Louisiana Purchase. The US settlers and territorial government organized the Attakapas Territory between 1807 and 1868. After Louisiana became a state, Saint Martin Parish was created. Attakapas Post was named Saint Martinville and designated as the county seat.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 6,114 people, 2,320 households, and 1,533 families residing in the city. The population density was 2,038 people per square mile (899.5/km\u00b2). There were 2,588 housing units at an average density of 862.67 per square mile (357.5/km\u00b2).

The city of St. Martinville is zoned to the Early Learning Center (Grades PK-K), St. Martinville Primary School (Grades 1-4), St. Martinville Junior High School (Grades 5-8) and St. Martinville Senior High School (Grades 9-12). The Evangeline campus of Louisiana Technical College is located in St. Martinville.\nThe economy of St. Martinville is fueled by agriculture and tourism. Agricultural production mainly yields crops of crawfish and sugar cane. The latter was a major commodity crop before the American Civil War, when it was dependent on the labor of African-American slaves. It has continued to be important.\n- St. Martin Parish contributes over 8,000,000 pounds of wild crawfish from the Atchafalaya Basin and another 14,000,000 pounds harvested from farming ponds annually to the overall production of Louisiana crawfish.\n- The Louisiana Sugar Cane Co-Op and historic St. John Mill, which is administered in St. Martinville, manage about 34,000 acres producing sugar cane throughout the State of Louisiana.\n- Cajun Chef Products, Inc. is the largest employer in the city. For 30 years, the Bulliard family has built a tradition of supplying quality Cajun food products nationwide. The business that began in 1958 with one product now distributes more than 250 products through fast food and other restaurants as well as other institutions. Approximately 100 employees maintain the local plant.\n- Peppers Unlimited of Louisiana, Inc. employs approximately 60 people from the St. Martinville area. The Bulliard family hot sauce recipe dates back to the turn of the 20th century, in 1910. There are four generations of Bulliards now represented in the pepper business. Products processed at the St. Martinville plant are made under the Louisiana Supreme label or private labels and are sold internationally.\nSt. Martinville is widely considered to be the birthplace of the Cajun culture and traditions, and it is in the heart of Cajun Country. A multicultural community in St. Martinville, with Acadians and Cajuns, Creoles (French coming via the French West Islands - Guadeloupe, Martinique and Santo Domingo), French, Spaniards, Africans and African Americans. Once New Orleans was founded and began to have epidemics, some New Orleanians escaped the city and came to St. Martinville. Its nickname, Petit Paris (\"Little Paris\"), dates from the era when St. Martinville was known as a cultural mecca with good hotels and a French theater, the Duchamp Opera House (founded in 1830), which featured the best operas and witty comedies. \nThe third oldest town in Louisiana, St. Martinville has many buildings and homes with beautiful architecture. The historic St. Martin de Tours Catholic Church and La Maison Duchamp on Main Street are part of the legacy of the Acadian people. The church was dedicated to Martin of Tours in France, where a St Martin de Tours church can be found. St. Martinville is the site of the \"Evangeline Oak\", featured in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem about the Acadian expulsion.\nIt is also the site of an African American Museum, and is included as a destination on the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail, which was established in 2008.\nSt. Martin de Tours Church is the oldest church parish in southwest Louisiana. It is known as the Mother Church of the Acadians because it was founded in 1765 upon the arrival of Acadians in this area. The current building has served as a center for religious activities in this predominantly Catholic community for over one hundred fifty years. At the side of the St. Martin de Tours Church is a monument dedicated to the Militiamen of St Martinville (36 of the militiamen were French Creoles, three were Acadians, and three colonial Americans, one's citizenship was not known) who took part with General Bernardo de Galvez in the Battle of Baton Rouge. The monument was erected by the Louisiana Daughters of the American Revolution.\nLa Maison Duchamp on Main Street in St. Martinville, Louisiana was built by Eug\u00e8ne and Am\u00e9lie Duchamp in 1876 as their town house. This St. Martinville landmark house has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places; future generations will be able to see its creative architecture.\nDuchamp Opera House, which dates to the mid-19th century, hosted many theatrical companies in its lifetime and has recently been completely restored. It once again hosts theatrical companies on the second floor.\nThe Evangeline Oak, made famous in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem, \"Evangeline\", stands on the bank of the Bayou Teche. Longfellow-Evangeline State Historic Site, containing an eighteenth-century Acadian cabin, the Creole Maison Olivier, and a museum interpreting Acadian life, is located north of the historic district.\nThe St. Martinville post office contains a mural, Evangeline, painted in 1940 by Minetta Good. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department.\nThe African American Museum, located in the historic district, uses the latest technology to provide insights into the culture and life of the Free People of Color in the community and their contributions to the Attakapas region from the 1750s on. They were integral to building and service trades. Many descended from Africans from the Senegambian region of West Africa and from French and Spanish colonists. \nThe newly renovated Old Teche Theater offers entertainment to the town. The 1930s Art Deco movie house is now converted into a television and film studio as well as a performing arts venue and recording studio.\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 267, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 267, "length": 3023, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 3290, "length": 1768, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5058, "length": 400, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5458, "length": 1505, "sectionHeading": "Economy", "sectionLabel": "city.economics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6963, "length": 1365, "sectionHeading": "Society", "sectionLabel": "city.society"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 8328, "length": 2456, "sectionHeading": "Attractions", "sectionLabel": "city.tourism"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverwood,_Kentucky", "type": "city", "title": "Riverwood, Kentucky", "abstract": "Riverwood is a home rule-class city in northeastern Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States.

More people entered along with one A.P. Miller of Toledo, Ohio, under a firm called the National Colony Organization. Miller named the new city after his wife's maiden name.\n", "text": "\"\nThe first European likely to have visited the Nobles County area of southwestern Minnesota was French explorer Joseph Nicollet. Nicollet mapped the area between the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers in the 1830s. He called the region \u201cSisseton Country\u201d in honor of the Sisseton band of Dakota Indians then living there. It was a rolling sea of wide open prairie grass that extended as far as the eye could see. One small lake in Sisseton Country was given the name \u201cLake Okabena\u201d on Nicollet\u2019s map, \u201cOkabena\u201d being a Dakota word meaning \u201cnesting place of the herons.\u201d\nThe town of Worthington was founded by \"Yankees\" (immigrants from New England and upstate New York who were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s).\nIn 1871, the St. Paul & Sioux City Railway Company began connecting its two namesake cities with a rail line. The steam engines of that time required a large quantity of water, resulting in water stations being needed every along their routes. One of these stations, at the site of present-day Worthington, was designated as \u201cThe Okabena Railway Station.\u201d \nMeanwhile, in that same year, Professor Ransom Humiston of Cleveland, Ohio, and Dr. A.P. Miller, editor of the Toledo Blade, organized a company to locate a colony of New England settlers who had already settled in Northern Ohio along the tracks of the Sioux City and St. Paul Railway. These were people were \"Yankee\" settlers whose parents had moved to the region of Northeast Ohio known as the Connecticut Western Reserve from the six New England states. These settlers were primarily members of the Congregational Church, though due to the Second Great Awakening, many of them had converted to Methodism and Presbyterianism, and some had become Baptists before coming to what is now Minnesota. This colony \u2013 the National Colony \u2013 was to be a village of temperance, a place where evangelical Methodists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Baptists could live free of the temptations of alcohol. A town was plotted, and the name was changed from the Okabena Railway Station to Worthington - Worthington being the maiden name of Dr. Miller\u2019s mother-in-law.\nOn April 29, 1872, regular passenger train service to Worthington was started, and on that very first train were the first of the National Colony settlers. One early arrival described the scene:\nWe were among the first members of the colony to arrive at the station of an unfinished railroad\u2026 There was a good hotel, well and comfortably furnished, one or two stores neatly furnished and already stocked with goods, [and] several other[s] in process of erection\u2026 The streets, scarcely to be defined as such, were full of prairie schooners, containing families waiting until masters could suit themselves with \u201cclaims,\u201d the women pursuing their housewifely avocations meanwhile \u2013 some having cooking stoves in their wagons, others using gypsy fires to do their culinary work; all seeming happy and hopeful.\nSome settlers from New England were however, drinking men, most of whom were civil war veterans from Massachusetts and Maine, who came into conflict with the temperance movement. A curious event took place on Worthington\u2019s very first Fourth of July celebration. Hearing that there was a keg of beer in the Worthington House Hotel, Professor Humiston entered the hotel, seized the keg, dragged it outside, and destroyed it with an axe. A witness described what happened next:\nUpon seeing this, the young men of the town thought it to be rather an imposition, and collected together, procured the services of the band, and under the direction of a military officer marched to the rear of the hotel, and with a wheelbarrow and shovel took the empty keg that had been broken open, and playing the dead march with flag at half staff marched to the flagpole in front of Humiston\u2019s office where they dug a grave and gave the empty keg a burial with all the honors attending a soldier\u2019s funeral.\"\nThey then, with flag at full mast and with lively air, marched back to the ice house, procured a full keg of beer, returning to the grave, resting the keg thereon. Then a general invitation was given to all who desired to partake, which many did until the keg was emptied\u2026 In the evening they reassembled, burning Prof. Humiston in effigy about 10 p.m. Thus ended the glorious Fourth at Worthington, Minn. \n\u2014Sibley Gazette July 5, 1872\nIn spite of tensions between pro-temperance and anti-temperance factions, the town grew rapidly. By the end of summer in 1872, eighty-five buildings had been constructed where just one year before there had been nothing but a field of prairie grass.\nSettlers poured into the region. At first they came almost exclusively from the six New England states due to issues of overpopulation combined with land shortages, which led to a stream of \"Yankee\" immigrants leaving that region. Some had come from Upstate New York and had parents and grandparents who had moved to that region from New England during the early 1800s and late 1700s. Due to the large number of New Englanders and New England transplants from upstate New York the town of Worthington, like much of Minnesota at this time, was very culturally continuous with early New England culture for much of its early history. It was the age of the Homestead Act when of government land could be claimed for free. All one had to do was live on the land and \u201cimprove\u201d it, a vague phrase if ever there was one. In such an atmosphere, settlers without connection to the National Colony also arrived in great number, and few of those were temperance activists. The ensuing winter was a severe one, and swarms of grasshoppers stripped farmers\u2019 fields bare in the summer of 1873. Still, settlers came. 1874 produced a bumper harvest, followed by another grasshopper invasion in 1875. 1876 and 1877 were both good farming years. Grasshoppers returned for the last time in 1879, and a bright future began for southwestern Minnesota. According to the 1880 census, Nobles County boasted 4435 residents, 636 of them living in Worthington.\nIn the early 1900s German immigrants began arriving in Worthington in large numbers, though this later group did not come directly from Germany, but rather (mostly) came to Worthington from other places in the midwest, especially the state of Ohio, where their communities had already been established.\nUnlike other parts of the country, the Germans were not subjected to xenophobia in Nobles County, Minnesota but rather were welcomed with open arms by the \"Yankee\" population who had established the town. This led to many writing back to Ohio, which led to chain migration to the region which greatly increased the German-American population. The \"Yankee\" population of old stock Americans of English descent did not come into conflict with the German-American community for much of their early history together in what is now Worthington. However, eventually the two communities would be divided on the issue of World War I in which the Yankee community would be divided and the Germans were unanimously opposed to American entry into the war. The Yankee community was generally pro-British, however many of the Yankees also did not want America to enter the war themselves. The Germans were sympathetic to Germany and did not want the United States to enter into a war against Germany, but the Germans were not anti-British. Prior to World War I, many German community leaders in Minnesota and Wisconsin spoke openly and enthusiastically about how much better America was than Germany, due primarily (in their eyes) to the presence of English law and the English political culture the Americans had inherited from the colonial era, which they contrasted with the turmoil and oppression in Germany which they had so recently fled. Other immigrant groups followed the Germans including setters from Ireland, Norway and Sweden. For German, Irish and Scandinavian immigrants seeking a new life, southwestern Minnesota was a new world.\nOn December 12, 2006 the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (I.C.E) staged a coordinated predawn raid at the Swift & Company meat packing plant in Worthington and at five other Swift plants in western states, interviewing workers and hauling hundreds off in buses.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Census now classifies Worthington as one of its micropolitan areas.

The community is located on the western edge of the growing Northwest Arkansas metropolitan area and has had a population increase of 47% to 15,039 between the 2000 and 2010 censuses.\nIn 2012, the city was named one of the 20 best small towns in America by Smithsonian magazine\n", "text": "Osage Indians were the known first inhabitants of the area. Siloam Springs' first white settlers were of German and Scots-Irish origin. Simon Sager is considered the founder of the town, then known as Hico.\nThe area is located in the Mid-South region of the country where the southern plains meet the Ozark Mountains. The city sits atop a plateau with many dogwood trees growing across the landscape. Siloam Springs is made up of Siloam Springs, Arkansas, and West Siloam Springs, Oklahoma. The latter is in the territory of the Cherokee Nation in northeastern Oklahoma.\nA perennial creek, named after the founder, Sager Creek, flows through the downtown area.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.71%, is water.\nThe Fayetteville\u2013Springdale\u2013Rogers Metropolitan Area consists of three Arkansas counties: Benton, Madison, and Washington, and McDonald County, Missouri. The area had a population of 347,045 at the 2000 census which had increased to 463,204 by the 2010 Census (an increase of 33.47 per cent). Siloam Springs is at the extreme western edge of this area, connected to the principal cities by Highway 412.\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification system, Siloam Springs has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \"Cfa\" on climate maps.\nJuly is the hottest month of the year, with an average high of and an average low of . Temperatures above are rare but not uncommon, occurring on average twice a year. January is the coldest month with an average high of and an average low of . Highs below occur on average thirteen times a year, with 2.2 nights per year dropping below . The city's highest temperature was , recorded on July 14, 1954. The lowest temperature recorded was , on February 12, 1899.\nPrecipitation is weakly seasonal, with a bimodal pattern: wet seasons in the spring and fall, and relatively drier summers and winters, but some rain in all months. The spring wet season is more pronounced than fall, with the highest rainfall in May. This differs slightly from the climate in central Arkansas, where the fall wet season is more comparable to spring.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 15,039 people in 5,138 households with 93.3% of the population in households. The racial and ethnic composition of the population was 76% non-Hispanic white, 0.8% black, 4.6% Native American, 1.6% Asian, 0.2% non-Hispanic reporting some other race, 5.0% from two or more races and 20.8% Hispanic or Latino.\nAt the 2000 census, there were 2,647 families residing in the city.

The median age was 30 years. For every 100 females there were 95.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.2 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $34,513, and the median income for a family was $41,153. Males had a median income of $27,339 versus $21,451 for females. The per capita income for the city was $16,047. About 9.5% of families and 12.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 17.6% of those under age 18 and 8.6% of those age 65 or over.\nAs of 2009, there were 52 churches that called Siloam Springs home by address. There are reports that Siloam Springs has a record for most number churches per capita, and while the ratio is higher than average, it has never been verified through reliable documentation. (Despite the large number of churches, the town does contain a small atheist/non-religious community.) Major employers in Siloam Springs include Gates Corporation, La-Z-Boy, DaySpring (a subsidiary of Hallmark Cards), Sager Creek Vegetable Company (formally Allen's Canning), Cobb-Vantress, and John Brown University.\nSiloam Springs has a City Administrator form of government. The government body consists of the Mayor, Board of Directors and District Judge. All positions are chosen by election. The other officials and commissioners are appointed with Board approval.\nIn addition to John Brown University, public education is supported by the Siloam Springs School District consisting of:\n- Siloam Springs High School (grades 9-12)\n- Siloam Springs Middle School (grades 7-8)\n- Siloam Springs Intermediate School (grades 5-6)\n- Southside Elementary School (grades 3-4)\n- Allen Elementary School (grades 1 & 2)\n- Northside Elementary School (grades Pre-K & K)\nSiloam Springs traffic is primarily served by US 412 (US 412) for east-west travel, connecting the city to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to the west via the Cherokee Turnpike and to Bentonville, Fayetteville, and Springdale, Arkansas, to the east. US 59 runs south from West Siloam Springs to Stilwell and Sallisaw, Oklahoma, while Arkansas 59 runs north to Gravette and south to Van Buren and Fort Smith, Arkansas. Within the city, major routes include Cheri Whitlock Drive, Lincoln Street, Main Street, Mount Olive Street, and University Street.\nSmith Field, located east of town, serves small business jets as well as double- and single-engine aircraft. It serves exclusively general aviation operations.\nThe city's primary water source is the Illinois River, although some water is purchased from Benton - Washington Regional Public Water Authority, whose source is Beaver Lake. The water is treated with chlorine, and the by-products of this chlorination process are kept compliant with the Arkansas Department of Health standards. Fluoride is added to supplement the naturally occurring amount present prior to treatment.\nWastewater is treated at the Siloam Springs Wastewater Treatment Plant (SSWWTP). Since effluent is discharged into a tributary of the Illinois, the plant's effluent is required to meet the treatment standards of both Arkansas and Oklahoma. The phosphorus load of the Illinois has been subject of controversy in the area, even reaching the United States Supreme Court in 1992. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has classified the Illinois as Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act, listing it as an \"impaired and threatened water\" due to the high phosphorus loads. As a result of the applicable strict phosphorus effluent regulations, SSWWTP upgraded its system in 2011. The upgrades also increased capacity 25% to 5.5 million gallons per day (MGD) (14,474 liters per hour). Although presently a traditional biological nutrient removal (BNR) plant capable of meeting the interim phosphorus limit, pilot tests have proven a chemical nutrient removal (CNR) and membrane biological reactor combination to be effective well below the possible future permit limit. However, due to the high cost, these phases have been delayed. Currently, a 3-year study is being conducted to determine the background phosphorus level in the Illinois. The future effluent limits will likely be written following the conclusion of the study. An EPA Total maximum daily load (TMDL) study in the watershed is also ongoing.\n\u2022 Jeremy Hedges (Class of 1991) - central figure in the investigation of shredded Whitewater documents at The Rose Law Firm in 1994, testified twice in front of a federal grand jury.\n- Bob Griggs, Host of The Bumpkin Bob Show\n", "annotations": [{"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 0, "length": 207, "sectionHeading": "History", "sectionLabel": "city.history"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 207, "length": 574, "sectionHeading": "Geography", "sectionLabel": "city.geography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 781, "length": 403, "sectionHeading": "Geography | Metropolitan area", "sectionLabel": "city.district"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 1184, "length": 1068, "sectionHeading": "Geography | Climate", "sectionLabel": "city.climate"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 2252, "length": 2529, "sectionHeading": "Demographics", "sectionLabel": "city.demography"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 4781, "length": 253, "sectionHeading": "Government", "sectionLabel": "city.politics"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5034, "length": 391, "sectionHeading": "Education", "sectionLabel": "city.education"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 5425, "length": 695, "sectionHeading": "Infrastructure | Transportation", "sectionLabel": "city.transport"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 6120, "length": 1824, "sectionHeading": "Infrastructure | Utilities", "sectionLabel": "city.facility"}, {"class": "SectionAnnotation", "begin": 7944, "length": 226, "sectionHeading": "Notable people", "sectionLabel": "city.people"}]}, {"id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsons,_Tennessee", "type": "city", "title": "Parsons, Tennessee", "abstract": "Parsons is a city in Decatur County, Tennessee, United States.

After the completion of the Western and Atlantic Railroad in 1842 the area began to grow. It was known by several names until 1872 \u2013 Varner's Station, Ruff's Siding, Neal Dow and Ruff's Station. The city was incorporated with the name Smyrna in 1872. \nTwo Civil War battles occurred in the area, the Battle of Smyrna Camp Ground and the Battle of Ruff's Mill, both on July 4, 1864.

State and federal representation is fairly evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. Community leaders and officeholders are traditionally conservative, but have in recent years become more socially moderate and interested in expanding public services.\nSince the late 1990s-to-early 2000s, an influx of young professionals and families in the community have led to \"new blood\" seeking office in municipal elections. Additionally, there has been an increase of women and minorities seeking, and winning, public office via elections and appointments. Local elections have become more heavily contested as well; it has become more and more rare for an officeseeker to run unopposed.\nAn interesting phenomenon beginning in the early 2000s concerns Smyrna's public school community. This association of individuals, families, PTA chapters, booster clubs, and foundations, particularly those supporting Campbell High School and its feeder schools, is very active and has a remarkable amount of political clout in the community. One manifestation of this experience is a social media-based group called Wave of Excellence. Although primarily focused on the growth and quality of public education in Smyrna, this community also occasionally lends its influence to other political matters such as economic development and local elections.\nThe median income for a household in the city for 2011 was $49,556, a 4% increase from 2000 and $3,549 over the Georgia average.

Included were a community center and public library. A mixed retail and residential district was modeled after an early 1900s city village, including a square with a fountain. This, and other expansions have revitalized the downtown area. Further redevelopment has occurred throughout the city\u2014including thousands of new homes - mostly cluster homes, townhouse and condo communities replacing older neighborhoods. The population has risen as a result of redevelopment, a few annexations, and Smyrna's location as a residential suburb in the Northwest center of metro Atlanta.\nThere is additional mixed retail/residential/office redevelopments around the \"Market Village\". Ground was broken in Jonquil Village, a redevelopment of Jonquil Plaza at the corner of Spring and Atlanta Road across from \"Market Village\". However, this development stalled due to banks withdrawing funding during the nationwide real estate crash of 2007\nLess than a down, the city intends to redevelop the Belmont Hills plaza, at the corner of Windy Hill and Atlanta Road in 2011. Both these villages, like \"Market Village\" in Smyrna, and \"Market Square\" in Vinings are designed to resemble a city village of yesteryear with fountains and antique street lamps. In 2011, Halpern Enterprises, the developer, sold some land to the city of Smyrna for an elementary school called the New Smyrna Elementary, which has completed construction. In 2012, Halpern rezoned the property but didn't change its intended use. It moved residential from a multi-story building in one section of the development to apartment residential by itself in a larger and previously empty section of the development (pod F) due to market constraints in the only slowly warming housing market, leaving the earlier section available for any use in the future.\nA Kroger plaza (Known as \"The Crossings\") has been built at the corner of Concord Road and South Cobb Drive with some planned two-story outparcels. This is actually a re-development of an older blighted strip-mall. The Kroger located there is one of the largest in the country, at .\nAdditional re-development is going on throughout the city, including the site at the corner of East-West Connector / Cumberland Parkway and South Cobb Drive. A shopping center with one of the first Sprouts Farmers Market organic grocery stores East of the Mississippi river is planned. Two outparcels have already been developed.\nSome additional work is being done in Smyrna are streetscape beautification projects, including a linear park on Concord Road along with new signage, lights, and a median on Atlanta Road. Additional parkland projects are the Taylor-Brawner Park, Riverview Road trail and Silver Comet Trail extensions in that area.\nSmyrna is home to The Bright Side, Smyrna and Vinings' Community Newspaper. The Bright Side is dedicated to publishing positive events that occur in Cobb County.\nSmyrna also has multiple private schools including Covenant Christian School, Whitefield Academy, and a satellite campus of Buckhead Preparatory Academy. The Lovett School is also nearby. \nSome extensions of the Silver Comet Trail have been built further into Smyrna to expand access to the trail.\n\"Market Village\" in the city center often has open-air concerts and festivals. There are also various small parks such as Cobb Park, public pools such as Aline Wolfe Center for the elderly and Tolleson park pool for the all ages, tennis courts and playgrounds and a linear park with walking trail along Spring Road.\nSeveral major roadways, such as I-285, Cobb Parkway (U.S. Route 41), Atlanta Road (Old State Route 3), and South Cobb Drive (State Route 280), pass through the municipality.\nSmyrna is served by Cobb Community Transit and Marta public buses.\nNotables from the area include U.S. Representative Bob Barr, actress Julia Roberts, baseball star Ron Gant, pastor Louie Giglio and football player Tay Glover-Wright.

The city was named after Cairo, the capital of Egypt.\nAlthough Cairo is nicknamed the \"Syrup City\", it has no relationship with the Karo brand of corn syrup, which is pronounced like the city's name. Rather, Cairo earned its nickname by producing cane syrup from the early 1900s through the late 1990s. Of the several companies that produced cane syrup, Roddenbery's was the best known. Roddenbery's later became better known for its pickles and the world's largest outdoor brine yard. However, the company was sold to Dean Foods in 1993 and the local factory shut down.\nReflecting its \"syrup\" heritage, the Cairo High School football team is nicknamed the Syrupmakers, and the school mascot is the agriculturally based sugar cane farmer/syrupmaker similar to the Cornhusker and Boilermaker. According to local tradition, this began during a rainy football game, when the players wore donated ponchos with \"Roddenbery Syrup\" printed on them. The most widely accepted tradition and the one with the most supportive evidence claims that a newspaper reporter referred to the Cairo Tigers in print as \"the syrupmakers from Cairo\".\nThe school's female athletic teams are named \"Syrup Maids\", often shortened to \"Maids\", while the male athletes are often dubbed \"Makers\". In 1986 ESPN chose \"Syrupmakers\" as the No. 1 nickname for a high school sports team. In 2009, ESPN's Sports Center selected the Syrupmakers as their number one mascot in the high school heritage category.\nCairo is close to great hunting, fishing, and points of historical interest. The local industrial base continues to grow with manufacturing, service, and healthcare companies anchoring a strong economy.\nThe area is home to several local festivals, including Calvary's Mule Day, Whigham's Rattlesnake Roundup, Cairo's own Antique Car Rally, and several competitive recreational programs. The Antique Car Rally features a wide range of cars, and includes many activities: a poker run, a parade, and even a street dance. It usually takes place on the second weekend of May.

The formerly separate town of Milstead is now part of Conyers.\n", "text": "Before European settlement, the area which is now Conyers, along with the surrounding county of Rockdale, was occupied by mound-building Native Americans. As time progressed, the Muscogee (or Creek) and Cherokee natives shared a common border here. This border was known as the \"Great Indian Road,\" and is known now as the \"Hightower Trail\". This trail was used by white settlers following the American Revolution.\nBetween 1816 and 1821, the area known as Rockdale was open for settlement. John Holcomb, a blacksmith, was the first settler in what is now Conyers. He settled where the current Rockdale County Courthouse is located, in the middle of Conyers on Main Street.\nEventually, there was pressure for a railroad to cross Georgia; the railroad was intended to run from Augusta, through neighboring Covington to Marthasville (now known as Atlanta). John Holcomb was against the railroad and refused to sell his land, and threatened to shoot anyone from the railroad who came onto his property.\nDr. W. D. Conyers, a banker from Covington, eventually persuaded John Holcomb into selling his land for $700. Dr. Conyers then sold the land to the Georgia Railroad. What is now Conyers began as a watering post along this line, named after Dr. Conyers. By 1845, the railroad was in full operation. By 1854, nearly 400 residents lived around the watering post, and Conyers was incorporated.\nConyers has been nearly destroyed several times by fire. It is said that it survived Sherman's March to the Sea thanks to a friend of Sherman's who lived in the area between Conyers and Covington. The story goes that the houses were spared because Sherman was uncertain where his friend lived. \nIn 1870, the surrounding area was incorporated into Rockdale County out of Newton County, Georgia, and Conyers became the county seat.\nOver the next decade, Conyers grew into a wild town. It had twelve saloons and five brothels. The more reputable side of the town had 40 stores, Conyers College, a hotel, a carriage manufacturer and good schools.\nThe Conyers post office contains a mural, The Ploughman, painted in 1940 by Elizabeth Terrell. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. The WPA was the largest and most ambitious American New Deal agency, employing individuals to carry out public works projects.\nConyers was also home to \"sidewalk churches\". Along Main Street grew First Methodist, Conyers Presbyterian, and First Baptist. It is said that at some point the congregants persuaded the brothels and saloons to close and leave Conyers for Covington, having persuaded them with a mob. This rose out of revivals began in 1878 with the Methodist and Presbyterian churches. First Baptist Church of Conyers moved out of downtown in late 2000, moving about two miles or three kilometers south of the Georgia International Horse Park to their current location.\nTightly connected to Conyers is Milstead, a mill town now incorporated into Conyers. At its peak, Milstead and Conyers had a private railroad which delivered products, such as cotton, from the mill to Conyers for shipping to the textile mills. In the 1960s, the mill closed.\nIn 1944, a Trappist monastery (a Catholic order), Abbey of the Holy Spirit, was established south of the city by Dom Frederic Dunne. The Protestant community of Rockdale County helped with the completing of the current structure. M. Basil Pennington, one of the founders of the Centering Prayer movement, was abbot of the monastery from 2000 to 2002.\nIn the 1950s, Conyers had a Coca-Cola bottling facility. In 1957, Lithonia Lighting moved from Lithonia.\nIn the 1960s, Interstate 20 was built through the county. Gus Barksdale, Clarence Vaughn, Roland Reagan, and Harry Downs helped establish the community for the future by pushing for business expansion.\nIn the 1970s, parts of the first five episodes of the Dukes of Hazzard were filmed in the town.\nIn the 1980s, Conyers became known for \"White Road\", where resident Nancy Fowler claimed to have seen apparitions of the Virgin Mary. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, Conyers played host to pilgrims.\nIn the early 1990s, several scenes of In the Heat of the Night were filmed around the Conyers Depot. Alan Autry, who played the character of Captain Bubba Skinner, was seen as a regular around Conyers during the filming.\nIn 1996 Conyers hosted the equestrian and mountain biking events for the 1996 Olympic Games held in Atlanta.

Since Rankin was the nearest settlement on a rail line, it became the center for the oil services industry for the nearby oil fields. During the Great Depression the population declined as the price of oil fell, and as workers moved away to work in newly discovered fields in East Texas and elsewhere; however, a secondary boom occurred in the 1940s with the discovery of the nearby Benedum Oil Field.

As early as 1638, John Winthrop, Jr. purchased Tantiusques a tract for mining lead centered at what is now Leadmine Road in Sturbridge (it was thought at the time that where there was lead, there should be silver nearby). In fact the mineral deposit was graphite which the Winthrops commercialized employing Nipmuck miners.\nSouthbridge was first settled by Europeans in 1730. In 1801 a poll parish, named the Second Religious Society of Charlton, and popularly called Honest Town, was formed from the west part of Dudley, the southwest part of Charlton and the southeast part of Sturbridge. In 1816 this parish was incorporated to become the township of Southbridge. Among the first settlers was Moses Marcy, who owned a home on the site of what is now Notre Dame church and was elected to Congress, and the Dennison family. Water power from the Quinebaug River made Southbridge a good location for sawmills and gristmills in the 18th century, and textile mills in the 19th century. After the Civil War, many immigrants of Irish and French Canadian descent came to work and live there; by the 1930s they had been joined by Poles, Greeks, Italians and others.\nSouthbridge has a long history of manufacturing optical products, earning it the unofficial title \"Eye of the Commonwealth\", in reference to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

The University of Georgia, the state's flagship public research university, is located in this college town, and contributed to its initial growth. In 1991, after a vote the preceding year, the original city abandoned its charter to form a unified government with Clarke County, referred to jointly as Athens-Clarke County.

On January 27, 1785, the Georgia General Assembly granted a charter by Abraham Baldwin for the University of Georgia as the first state-supported university. Sixteen years later, in 1801, a committee from the university's board of trustees selected a site for the university on a hill above Cedar Shoals, in what was then Jackson County. On July 25, John Milledge, one of the trustees and later governor of Georgia, bought from Daniel Easley and donated it to the university. Milledge named the surrounding area Athens after the city that was home to the Platonic Academy of Plato and Aristotle in Greece.\nAthens officially became a town in December 1806 with a government made up of a three-member commission. The university continued to grow, as did the town, with cotton mills fueling the industrial and commercial development. Athens became known as the \"Manchester of the South\" after the city in England known for its mills. In 1833 a group of Athens businessmen led by James Camak, tired of their wagons getting stuck in the mud, built one of Georgia's first railroads, the Georgia, connecting Athens to Augusta by 1841, and to Marthasville (now Atlanta) by 1845. In the 1830s and 1840s, transportation developments combined with the growing influence of the University of Georgia made Athens one of the state's most important cities as the antebellum era neared the height of its development. The university essentially created a chain reaction of growth in the community which developed on its doorstep.\nDuring the American Civil War, Athens became a significant supply center when the New Orleans armory was relocated there to what is now called the Chicopee building. Fortifications can still be found along parts of the North Oconee River between College and Oconee St. In addition, Athens played a small part in the ill-fated Stoneman's Raid when a skirmish was fought on a site overlooking the Middle Oconee River near what is now the old Macon Highway. As in many southern towns, there is a Confederate memorial. It is located on Broad Street, near the University of Georgia Arch.\nDuring Reconstruction, Athens continued to grow. The form of government changed to a mayor-council government with a new city charter on August 24, 1872, and Captain Henry was elected as the first mayor of Athens. Henry Beusse was instrumental in the rapid growth of the city after the Civil War. After holding the position of mayor, he worked in the railroad industry and helped to bring railroads to the region, creating growth in many of the surrounding communities. Freed slaves moved to the city, where many were attracted by the new centers for education such as the Freedmen's Bureau. This new population was served by three black newspapers: the Athens Blade, the Athens Clipper, and the Progressive Era.\nIn the 1880s, as Athens became more densely populated, city services and improvements were undertaken. The Athens Police Department was founded in 1881 and public schools opened in fall of 1886. Telephone service was introduced in 1882 by the Bell Telephone Company. Transportation improvements were also introduced with a street paving program beginning in 1885 and streetcars, pulled by mules, in 1888.\nBy its centennial in 1901, Athens was a much-changed city. A new city hall was completed in 1904. An African-American middle class and professional class grew around the corner of Washington and Hull Streets, known as the \"Hot Corner\", where the Morton Building was constructed in 1910. The theater at the Morton Building hosted movies and performances by black musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, and Duke Ellington. In 1907 aviation pioneer Ben T. Epps became Georgia's first pilot on a hill outside town that would become the Athens-Ben Epps Airport. Athens got its first tall building in 1908 with the seven-story Southern Mutual Insurance Company building. \nDuring World War II, the U.S. Navy built new buildings and paved runways to serve as a training facility for naval pilots. In 1954, the U.S. Navy chose Athens as the site for the Navy Supply Corps school. The school was located in Normal Town in the buildings of the old Normal School. The school closed in 2011 under the Base Realignment and Closure process. The site is now home to the University of Georgia/Medical College of Georgia Medical Partnership, the University of Georgia College of Public Health, and other health-related programs\nIn 1961, Athens witnessed part of the civil rights movement when Charlayne Hunter and Hamilton Holmes became the first two black students to enter the University of Georgia. Despite the Brown vs. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling in 1954, the Athens\u2013Clarke County school district remained segregated until 1964.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the balance has a total area of , of which is land and (0.41%) is water.\nAthens lies within the humid subtropical climate zone, with hot, humid summers and mild to moderately cold winters. Annual rainfall averages . Light to moderate snowfall can occur in winter. In the spring, frequent thunderstorms can sometimes become severe, even producing tornadoes.

The population was 21,692 at the 2010 census, and in 2016 the estimated population was 22,490. It is included in the Elizabethtown\u2013Fort Knox Metropolitan Area.\nIts economy is largely dominated by the adjacent U.S. Army base Fort Knox and by the nearby city of Elizabethtown. Radcliff's population previously fluctuated greatly depending on the deployments of the units at the base, but the BRAC reorganization of 2005, and the quartering of the U.S. Army's Human Resources Command to Fort Knox has created a larger and more stable population.\n", "text": "Radcliff is located in northern Hardin County at (37.829918, -85.945541). It is bordered to the north by Fort Knox and to the west by Vine Grove.

McCullum named the new community after Major William Radcliffe, head of the Quartermaster Corps at the newly established Camp Henry Knox. After selling the general store which he had opened in the new town, McCullum no longer played a role in the development of the town.\nThe next significant step in Radcliff's history took place during the 1930s when Fort Knox expanded and dislocated the towns of Stithton and New Stithton, causing various residents and businesses of those communities to move to Radcliff. During World War II, thousands of soldiers trained at Fort Knox and spent their leisure hours at the USO in Radcliff.\nHardin Water District No. 1 was formed in 1953, and became a reality in 1955 with the sale of bonds to finance the project.

The population was estimated at 800. The population growth of Radcliff over the last 50 years is due to the transient military population, and trends are showing a plateau and decline. At one time, Radcliff was larger than Elizabethtown, but that was short-lived after the 2000 census and more so after the BRAC transformation at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Starting with 800 in 1956, the Census Bureau reported populations of 3,381 in 1960, 8,281 in 1970, 14,519 in 1980, and 21,961 in 2000.\nIn 1988, a youth group from the First Assembly of God in Radcliff was involved in the worst drunk-driving accident in U.S. history, a bus accident in which a drunk driver going the wrong way on Interstate 71 hit the group's vehicle, killing 27 people in the crash and the resulting fire.\nIn mid-October 2011, the city voted on the approval of alcohol sales.
